THE ROYAL GARLAND.
SCENE a romantic Country.
CALLIOPE discovered in a contemplative Attitude.
CHORUS of SHEPHERDS.
CHief of the nine! awake! awake!
Oh! snatch thy heav'nly lyre:
The poet's sullen silence break,
And all his soul inspire!
With numbers charm th' attentive ear,
That kings may condescend to hear.
GENIUS of ENGLAND enters.
RECITATIVO.
Hear'st thou not, goddess, how the mingled cries
Of Britain's sons invoke thee?
—What incites
Their eager strain? and wherefore gleam these shades
With that surrounding glow of holy lustre,
Shed from thy radiant form?
What?—shall the royal stranger,
Who graces with his steps thy fav'rite isle,
Shall he depart, unhonour'd of the muse?
His birth, and near alliance to the throne,
And fond affection for thy plains, alike
Neglected and unsung?
SONG.
Him a nation's shouts approve,
Nobles praise, and monarchs love:
His the grace of Courts, and state,
Regal honours round him wait.
Commerce, lo! unlocks her stores,
At his feet her treasure pours,
Opens all her ample breast,
To thank, and hail the royal guest.
None the grateful debt refuse,
Save alone the slumb'ring muse.
Awake! awake! thy heav'nly lyre,
All the poet's soul inspire!
RECITATIVE.
It needs not, awful pow'r, in simple phrase
Plain as their honest souls, Britannia's sons
Can speak their gratitude.
CHORUS heard behind.
Duly we our tributes bring,
To grace the youth, to praise the king.
And hark! their notes—
Spontaneous fill the air
Exeunt Shepherds.
.—So thy good influence
Reigns in their bosoms, and directs their minds;
They want no aid from me.
SONG.
Round the Briton's gen'rous heart
Sincerity instinctive flows,
Strong and clear, as round his isle
Ocean's ample torrent shews;
Labor'd strains of artful praise
Flatt'ring tongues beseem alone;
Manly sense, and genuine truth
Have a language of their own.
Exeunt separately.
SCENE a Wood.
Young SHEPHERD and SHEPHERDESS seated on a Bank.
SONG.
Since my Delia's plighted vow,
Softly-sweet the hours have flown;
Many such may fate allow,
Ere our loves and days are done!
Since Palemon's plighted vow,
Softly-sweet the hours have flown;
Many such may fate allow,
Ere our loves and days are done!
SONG.
Oh! what bliss the nuptial vow
On their lives must show'r,
Who, like us, with joy look back,
And bless th' auspicious hour!
When content approves the wish,
By young desire inflam'd,
And reason justifies the choice,
Which early passion fram'd!
OLD SHEPHERD enters.
RECITATIVO.
Fye, loit'ring boy!—why sit you idle here,
Lost to the highest duty of the year?
Our harvest done, say how should we improve
The moments better than in tales of love?
SONG.
By your own good example, dear father, we're taught,
That love must be cherish'd, when once he is caught:
That time for our pleasure too hastily flies,
And the summer of life is the season of joys.
'Tis true; yet awhile lay your raptures apart,
Let another enjoyment take place in your heart,
The stranger whose presence has honour'd your lands,
Your gratitude merits, your tribute demands.
In strains of pure nature our shepherds unite,
To open their bosoms, and shew their delight;
To gaze on his glories tumultuous they throng,
And the sense of his virtue enriches the song.
Then away to the grove, where the rites they prepare,
Let's share their employment, their pleasure let's share,
What task to the bosom so grateful can prove,
As the tribute of duty, sweet offspring of love?
No task to the bosom so grateful can prove,
As the tribute of duty, sweet offspring of love.
Exeunt.
SCENE Opens to an extensive rural Prospect. Shepherds and Shepherdesses variously employed, in culling Flowers, finishing wreaths, &c. A large coronet of Flowers in the Center.
GENIUS of ENGLAND enters.
SONG.
Is the mystic garland wave,
Token best of rural love?
All arrang'd in order neat?
All is finish'd,—all compleat.
Has the myrtle with the rose
Vy'd in sweetness, to compose
A symbol for the noble youth,
Of early love and mutual truth?
Has the oak his branch entwin'd,
Of British strength and truth combin'd,
Emblem firm, memorial meet?
All is finish'd,—all compleat.
RECITATIVO.
'Tis well,—
Yet 'ere the vessel from the crouded shore
Tear your imperial guest, resume the song;
And let it teem with wishes, such as suit
The grateful, kind, and hospitable heart.
That done, in blythesome measures seek the Youth,
And lay your duties at his royal feet.
SONG.
Gentle seas, propitious gales,
Waft his vessel, swell his sails!
So secure on Dania's plain,
Long and happy may he reign!
So secure on Dania's plain,
Long and happy may he reign!
No hostile arm his realms annoy,
Impair his state, or damp his joy!
So may all his moments prove,
Rich in grandeur, rich in love!
So may all his moments prove,
Rich in grandeur, rich in love!
In smiles of health and rapture drest,
His blooming consort charm his breast!
And favour'd subjects ever sing,
The wife and sister of a king!
And favour'd subjects ever sing,
The wife and sister of a king!
To our much-lov'd lord ally'd,
Nearer by their virtues ty'd,
May nought destroy the friendly band,
That links our shores to Danian land.
May nought destroy the friendly band,
That links our shores to Danian land.
TO CONCLUDE WITH A GARLAND DANCE.

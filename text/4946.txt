A TABLE of VOWELS, DIPHTHONGS and TERMINATIONS, the
English sound
of which cannot be easily expressed in
foreign
letters, and should therefore be learned by ear, viz.
I
long,
There are two ways of sounding the long i and y, (though both long,) the one a little different from the other, and requiring a little extension of the mouth, as may be seen by comparing the following words, viz.
I
and
aye, high
and
high-ho, by't
(for
by it
) and
bite, sigh'd
and
side, strive
and
strife,
&c but this difference, being so nice, is not to be attained but by much practice, neither is it very material.
as in
bible, mitre, nitre, pirate.
O
and
u
short, before a consonant in the same syllable, as in
odd, nod, lord,
&c. and in
mud, strut, stun, urn,
&c.
Oi
and
oy,
which have both the same sound, as in
oil, boil, coil, boy, coy, hoy,
&c.
Ou
and
ow (
not like the French
ou,
in the pronunciation of which the lips are almost closed, but) with an open articulation, as in
pound, our, gown, power.
Also the following terminations, viz.
-ire,
-tion
-cious
-tious
as in
dire, fire, salvation, delicious, fictitious,
&c.

Particular exceptions concerning
a
at the end of a syllable.
A
is like the French
a,
or English diphthong
aw,
in
wa-ter;
it has a medium-sund between
aw
and the English
a
in
fa-ther,
and the last syllable of
pa-pa, mam-ma;
and it sounds like a short
e,
or foreign
é,
in
a-ny
and
ma-ny.
Particular exceptions concerning
i.
I
sounds like the English
e,
or foreign
i,
in
ac-qui-esce, bi-er, pi-er, ti-er.
General exceptions concerning
i.
I
is pronounced short before another vowel in the termination of all words of more than two syllables when it is not radical; as in
a′-mi-a-ble, de-mo-ni-ac′, ca′r-ri-age, so′-ci-al, Wi′l-li-am, Sty′g-i-an, da′l-li-ance, va′l-i-ant, Span′-i-ard, a′-pi-ary, so′-ci-al, in-sid-ia′-tor, al-le-vi-a′-tion, ma′r-ri-ed, a′-li-en, co′n-sci-ence, am′-bi-ent, gla′-si-er, spe′-ci-es, se-rag′-li-o, ax′-i-om, pos-te′-ri-or, wa′r-ri-our, con′-sci-ous, i′d-i-ot, pre′-mi-um,
&c. But, in the proper names
Mari′-a
and
So-phi′-a,
when given to English women, it is pronounced according to rule. Also in
af-fi-ance,
and the derivatives from the dissyables ending in
y,
which are mentioned in the example; as
al-li′-ance, com-pli′-ance, de-ni′-al, de-fi′-ance,
and
re-li′-ance,
wherein the
i
When
i
is substituted for
y,
in the terminations of derivatives, it retains the sound of the
y
in the original word, whether long or short; therefore
i
is short in
cā r-ri-er, cā r-rĭ-ed,
and
cā rrĭ-es;
and is like the
y
in the primitive words before specified in
al-li ance, de-ni al, digni-fied, im-plies,
&c.
retains the sound of the
y
in the original words, and is accented accordingly.
Particular exceptions concerning
o.
O
is like
oo
in
do,
(and its compounds,)
to,
and
who,
though the latter
(who)
is pronounced according to the rule in the northern parts of England.
U
is like the English
ou
(hereafter explained) in the first syllable of
cu-cumber.
General exception concerning
y.
Y,
at the end of all words of two or more syllables, (except those mentioned in the example,) is pronounced like a short
i,
as in
carry, envy, commissary,
&c. the accent being laid on one of the former syllables.
A Repetition
of
RULE II.
respecting
Vowels,
or
Voice-Letters,
in syllables ending with a consonant.

&c.
The short sound of the two other vowels (viz.

) must be acquired by ear, (see page 5,) as in
odd, got, not, rob,
&c. and in
mud, grub, strut, stun,
&c.

and
lt,
as in

&c. in all primitive monosyllables ending in
ll,
(except

and
mall,
which are pronounced according to rule,) as in
all, gall, fall,
&c. and before
lk,
(wherein
l
is mute,) as
balk, stalk, walk, talk,
&c. but, before
lf, lm, lve,
and before
nd
in words derived from the Latin word

it is sounded like the Italian
a,
only somewhat shorter, as in

as in
high, nigh, light, &c.
in which
gh
is mute, having no other use than that of lengthening the
i.
It is long also before
gn
at the end of a word, and the
g
is mute, as in
be-nign, sign,
and its compounds
consign, design, &c.
and their derivatives in

RULE V.
Oi
and

final sounds like
f;
but

e
in

and
hei-fer;
and like the diphthong
ai
in
hei-nous, heir, lei-sure,
(though sometimes like a short
e
in
lei-sure,) skein, their, veil,
and
vein.
General exceptions concerning
ei.
Ei
is like the long English
i
when it is not followed by a consonant in the same syllable; as in
Pleï-a-des, Hei-del-berg, Hei-den-heym, Rei-gate,
&c. but in
ei-ther
and
nei-ther
it is sometimes like the English
a
long, and sometimes according to rule, like the English
e
long.
Ei
is like the English
a
in all words wherein it precedes
-gh, gn,
and
-nt,
in the same syllable, as
weigh, freight, deign, feign,
&c. (in all which
g
is mute,)
feint, teint,

Particular exceptions concerning

e
in

and
oe.
Ie
and
oe
at the end of a word are always like the first vowel in each diphthong, viz.
ie
like
i
long, and
oe
like
o
long, as in
die, foe,
&c. except in two words,
shoe
and
canoe,
wherein
oe
is commonly like
oo.
N. B.
The same is to be observed of the diphthong
ue
and
ye
at the end of a word; the former being like a long
u,
and the latter like a long
i,
as in
due, pye,
&c. the same likewise when
s
is added to make the plural nouns or third person singular of verbs, as
dies, foes, dues, pies,
&c. and the
s
so added is pronounced like z.
RULE X.
Eu, ew,
and
iew,
like a single
u
long,
Eau in
beauty
(and its derivatives) has likewise the same sound.
as in
Eu-rope, eu-nuch, brew, dew, view,
&c.
Except
ew
in
sew,
which is commonly sounded like a long
o.
RULE XI.
Oa
is pronounced like
o
long, as in
boat, coat, grown, moan,
&c.
Except in
broad, a-broad,
and
groat,
wherein it partakes a little of the sound of

ue
like a short
e,
as in
guess, guest,
&c. and
ui
like a short
i,
as in
build, guild, conduit,
&c. but in words ending with silent
e,
the diphthong

bruise, cruise, fruit, juice, nui-sance, pur-suit, re-cruit, sluice, suit,
and
suit-or,
which are sounded as if spelt
bruze, cruze, nu-sance,
&c.
N. B.
When
ua, ue, ui,
and
uo,
follow
q
in the same syllable, the
u
has the power of
w,
which power cannot more easily be expressed to foreigners than by comparing it to the sound of
u
in the French word
quoi!
or
quoy!
as in
quar-rel, quack, ques-tion, quick, quite, quit, quote,
&c.

AN APPENDIX, CONTAINING A brief Account OF THE CHIEF PECULIARITIES OF THE
ENGLISH CONSONANTS,
By the late Rev. Mr. T. S.
AN APPENDIX, &c.
1.
B
is mute before
t,
or after
m,
in the same syllable, as
debt, lamb,
&c.
2.
C
sounds soft, like
s,
when followed by
e, i,
or an apostrophe, (denoting the absence of
e,
) as
cedar, city, danc'd,
&c.
C
sounds like
sh,
when followed by
ea, ia, ie,
or
io,
making different syllables, as
ocean, ancient, precious, social,
&c. except
society.
CC,
when followed by
e
or
i,
sounds like
x,
as in
accept, accident,
&c.
C
is mute in
indict, victuals, scene, scent, science, sciatica, scissors, scission, scymitar, scythe,
and the proper names,
Scyros, Scylla,
and
Scythia.
In all other cases
c
sounds hard like
k.
3.
Ch,
when properly English, has the same sound with the Italian
c
before
e
or
i.
Example,
child, chain,
&c.
It sounds also like
sh
in words derived from the French, as
chaise, Champaigne,
&c. and like
k
in words of Greek extraction, as
Christ, school, stomach, archangel,
&c. pronounced
ark-angel.
But if
arch
comes before a consonant,
ch
has then its proper English sound, as in
arch-bishop.
Ch
in
loch
sounds like
f.
Ch
is mute in
drachm, schedule,
and
schism.
4.
D
is mute before
ge,
as in
judge, bridge,
&c. also in
soldier.
5.
F
in
of
sounds like
v.
6.
G
sounds
soft
like
j
before
e, i,
or an
apostrophe,
and
hard
(like the Greek γ) in all other cases.
Example.
Angel, rage, rag'd, giant, ginger,
&c.
Exceptions to
g
's sounding soft.
1. In the participles passive of words ending in
g
hard (and also whereever
g
is doubled) it continues hard, notwithstanding the vowels
e
or
i,
or an
apostrophe,
as in
dragg'd, begging, digging,
&c.
2. In the termination
ger,
wherever it makes a distinct syllable,
g
sounds hard, as in
an-ger, fin-ger, lon-ger, stron-ger,
&c. in which kind of words it may be observed, that the
g
sounds double, so as to belong to both syllables.
3. Derivatives in
er, ed,
or
ing,
from primitives in
ng,
retain the
g
hard, as
sing-ing, sing-er,
from
sing; hang-ing, hang-er,
from
hang; wing-ed,
or
wing'd,
from
wing,
&c. in which kind of words it may be observed, that
g
sounds
single,
and belongs to the
first syllable only.
4. In the following words
g
is hard notwithstanding it comes before
e
or
i;
viz.
geese, gewgaw, geld, gelt, Gertrude, get,
(with its compounds,)
gibberish, gibbous, giddy, gift, gig, giggle, gild, girl, give, for-give, gilt, gimblet, gimp, gird, girt, girdle, be-gin, gizzard, Gideon, Gibbons, Gilbert,
and
Gilpin.
G is mute before
n
in the same syllable, as
guash, sign, sovereign,
&c. also in
phlegm, seraglio,
and
bagnio.
7.
Gh
sounds like
g
hard in
ghost,
and like
ff
in
cough, lough, laugh, laughter, rough, slough, tough, trough,
and
enough.
In other words it is mute.
8.
H
is mute in
hour, honour, honest, heir, herb, humour, hostler, thyme, John, Thomas, Thomasin,
and
Thames.
Also in Greek words when preceded by R, as
rheum, rhyme, rhetoric, myrrh,
&c. and, lastly, at the end of words, as
ah, hah, Isaiah, Sarah,
&c.
9.
K
is mute before
n
in the same syllable, as in
knave, know, knight,
&c.
10.
L
is mute in
balk, talk, walk, stalk, halm, calm, calf, calves, falcon, half,
alves, holme,
(an island,) and
Holmes,
(a surname,)
psalm, qualm, salmon, could, should,
and
would.
11.
N
is mute after
m
in the same syllable, as
hymn, autumn, solemn,
&c.
12.
P
is mute before
s,
and between
m
and
t,
as
psalm, tempt,
&c.
13.
Ph
is always sounded like
f,
except in
Stephen, nephew,
and
phial,
where it sounds like
v.
Ph
is mute in
phthisic,
and is pronounced
tizzic.
14.
Q
is always followed by
u,
and, when it begins a syllable, sounds like
cw,
by which (as Mr Johnson observes) our Saxon ancestors well expressed it. But, in terminations from the Latin
-quus,
and also in words of French extraction, it sounds like
k.
Example.
Oblique, antique, quoif, conquer, risque, traffique,
&c. some of which words are now more commonly spelt with
c
or
k,
as
coif, risk, traffic,
&c.
15.
S
sounds like
z.
1. In the third persons singular of all verbs, and the plural number of all nouns, as in
has, was, tries, bees, times,
&c.
2. In pronouns possessive, as
his, hers, theirs,
and also when preceded by the comma denoting possession, as
father's, mother's, Tom's, Will's,
&c. Also in the particle
as.
Exceptions to the two last Sections.
S
has its proper sound when preceded by
c, k, ck, f, p, q,
or
t,
which admit not the sound of
z
so easily after them, as in
speaks, beats, rocks, Jack's, Dick's, Gilbert's, cock's spur, cat's paw,
&c.
3.
S
sounds like
z
preceded by a liquid in the same syllable, as
damsel, crimson, Thames, Jersey, Guernsey,
&c. and also,
4.
S,
between two vowels, most commonly sounds like
z,
as
daisy, reprisal, pleasant, please, rosin,
&c.
Except
house, mouse, louse, goose, geese, sausage, purchase, promise, case, mason, bason, basis, phasis,
and
thesis.
Except also substantives in
use,
derived from Latin verbs, as
use, abuse, disuse, refuse, excuse,
&c. and adjectives derived from the participles passive of some Latin verbs, as
recluse, profuse, abstruse,
&c.
Lastly, Except also the words contained in the next section but one, where
s
sounds like
zh.
II.
S
and
ss
sound like
sh
in
sure,
(with its compounds,)
issue, tissue, fissure, pressure, Russian,
&c. also in the terminations
-assion, -ession, -ission, -ussion,
as in
passion, impression, mission, concussion,
&c.
III.
S,
when preceded by a vowel, and followed by
ion
or
ian,
sounds like
zh,
as
invasion, Ephesian, vision, delusion,
&c. But if it be preceded by a consonant, it sounds like
sh,
as in
conversion, Persian,
&c.
S
sounds also like
zh
before
-ier,
as
osier, hosier, glasier, brasier,
&c. and in the words
leisure, measure, pleasure,
and
treasure.
S
is mute in
isle, Lisle, Carlisle, island, viscount,
and
demesne.
16.
T,
before
io
or
ia,
(making part of the same syllable with
i,
) sounds like
sh,
as
nation, cautious, Egyptian, satiate,
&c. But, if
t
belong to the former syllable, its retains its proper sound, as
question, fustian, combustion,
&c.
T
is mute in words ending with
-stle,
as
castle, thistle, bristle,
&c.
Th
has two sounds; the one soft, as in
thy,
the other hard, (like the Greek θ,) as in
thigh.
I.
Th
sounds soft,
1st, in
thence, there,
(with their compounds,)
then, that, the, thee, these, this, those, thus, thou, thy, thine, their, theirs, them, though, although, beneath, bequeath, betroth, mouths, tythe, seythe, wreath, booth,
and in the verbs
bathe, mouth, seeth, loathe, soothe,
and
breathe.
2dly, Wherever it occurs between two vowels, as
father, mother,
&c. except words of Greek extraction, and also derivatives from words ending with
th
hard, as
earthen
from
earth,
&c.
3dly,
Th
sounds soft when placed between
r
and a vowel, as
burthen, murther,
&c. though in such words
d
is often pronounced instead of
th,
as
murder, burden.
In other cases
th
sounds
hard.
Th
is mute in
asthma,
with its derivatives.
18.
W
is mute before
r
in the same syllable, as
write, wrath,
&c. also in
sword, swoon,
and
answer,
with their compounds and derivatives.
The other consonants have the same powers as in other languages.
The
Lord's Prayer,
the
Creed,
and the
Ten Commandments, &c.
divided into syllables, (according to the
rule for spelling
recommended by the learned Bishop Lowth,) with references placed to those syllables which are
exceptions
to the several
rules
laid down in this book respecting the pronunciation of vowels and diphthongs.

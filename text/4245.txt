THE WIDOW's VOW. A FARCE, IN TWO ACTS, AS IT IS ACTED AT THE THEATRE ROYAL,
HAY-MARKET.
LONDON:
INTED FOR G. G. J. AND J. ROBINSON, PATER-NOSTER-ROW. 1786.
PROLOGUE,
Written by Mr. HOLCROFT,
Spoken by Mr. BANNISTER, jun.
PROLOGUES, with caustic touch, have often tried
To probe your spleen, prove knaves and fools allied;
Have twisted words and wit ten thousand ways,
To shew that these are most degenerate days!
A different task be ours.—We'll prove that you
Are wise and happy. Nay! tho' strange, 'tis true!
First on your
safety
think! now belles appear
By ample bulwarks guarded, front and rear!
Now male and female amble, side by side,
Exempt from harm, by breast-works fortify'd!
Here polygons defend Miss Molly's breast!
There horn-works hush the husband's fears to rest!
By ramparts, daily rais'd, he's freed from cares;
If he'll but grant sufficient for repairs.
Our strength thus prov'd, proceed we to disclose
How new-made wealth thro' new-made channels flows!
How rich we are, in medal-rust and rare things!
In copper coins, gilt pence and—Queen-Anne-farthings!
How shells, stuff'd monkies, and Cremonas old,
In hand of Auctioneer, are current gold!
He "Going! going!" cries. "The hammer's up!
"This fine antique! this Roman—
caudle-cup!"
A gem so rare makes connoisseurs turn pale,
Fearful, alike, to purchase or to fail!
Hope trembles, starts, from lip to lip rebounds,
Till down she's knock'd by—Ah!—one thousand pounds!
The envied purchaser, with joy e
ate,
Pays for his prize by—felling his estate!
While
Smirk,
in florid style, words nicely plac'd,
Protests theee lot does,
anner
to his taste!
Mimick
Yes! sure you're happy! and should rest content,
Now landscapes are reduced fifteen per cent:
And Claude's and Titian's new-found wonders may
By new-made Peers be bought—if new-made Peers to pay.
Assuming sorrow.
One thing, indeed, may well your peace invade,
Pawnbrokers! threaten you to leave off trade!
W
t
Returning to his former chearful tone.
All things considered, now, while safety smiles,
And wealth inundates thus our Queen of isles;
While Vickery head defects so soon repairs,
And half unpeoples Greenland of her bears;
While exhibitions, galas and reviews,
Lisle-street, Vauxhall, the Abbey, Handel, Hughes,
Flutes, fiddles, trombos, double-drums, bassoons,
Mara, the speaking-figure, fish-balloons,
Earth-baths, live-eagles, such as never flew,
L' Hercule du Roy!
and General Jackoo!
While these create a round of such delight,
Sure, we may hope, you will not frown to-night!
While farces numerous as these go down,
Our farce may in its turn amuse the town;
And, smiling thus on Folly's vast career,
Sure not on us, alone, you'll be severe!

But my dear sister, did not you seduce me to this melancholy spot, on a promise

rompted my wishes, but since I have beheld her,
is love.
Beheld her!
Yes, beheld her—walking in her

But how?—How contrive to see
?—
From the top of our house, through
elescope—but, my dear sister, do bring us a
le nearer, or I'll purchase a speaking trumpet,
make love to her through it, though my
ssion be heard by every soul within a quarter of
ile.
I tell you I have great hopes.
But why not accept of her ac
intance, and prevail on her yourself to see
?
I tell you again, the letters I expect

And yet I would not compel her to

Do not let your scrupulous honor overcome all your future prospects—Notwithstanding these letters will strongly recommend you, yet it will be with her own consent only she will yield to the recommendation.
But when do you expect the letters?
Every instant—my servants are no
gone to the Post-office.
I'll fly and see if they are
turned.
Do; for as soon as the letters are
rived, I would not have you lose a moment
away, and know your fate at once—yet if she

INIS.
Well, Inis—I am impatient to he
▪ What success?
Delightful, Madam—I have been intro
ced to the young Countess—I first communi
ted the intelligence of the pretended plot form
g against her to her waiting-woman, who was
fficiently alarmed at it, to take me to her Lady
mediately.
Well.
And so, Madam, as soon as I was in
duced I fell a crying—I thought that was the
st way.
Very well.
And then, before I discovered what I had say, I made her promise not to betray me,
ch she did most solemnly, and without the
st reluctance—and now, Madam, says I, I
servant with your neighbour, Donna Isabella,
ighty Lady, who turns every thing serious and
ed into ridicule; and she has resolved to make
t of you for pretending an aversion to men,
for that purpose she has procured recom
ndations for you to receive the visits of the
ng Marquis her brother, but instead of him,
purposes to come herself, disguised as a man,
vail on you to consent to be married to her,
then throw off the mask, and make you and
vow the jest of the whole kingdom.
This is all right—go on.
On this she thanked me a thousand times
the discovery.
But did she say she would receive
?
Oh yes—she has promised to receive you on my account, that my divulging the scheme may not be detected.
And she is absolutely resolved to receive
me
under the title of my brother?
You may depend upon it—but how are you to proceed now?
Send my brother to her immediately.
Your brother!
Yes—The Countess, from what you have told her, will suppose him a woman, receive him, and consequently suffer a thousand endearing familiarities; till, charmed by the graces of his mind and person, she shall love him without
knowing
it, and, when she detects the impostor, be unable to part with him.
And if she is like me, she'll think it the happiest day of her life—but have you prepared your brother how to act his part?
He has nothing to
act,
being the very person he represents, and therefore shall not know of the art by which he is introduced—for, except being a little too attentive to dress and etiquette, a circumstance which, with his youthful appearance, favours our design, he is one of the mo
amiable young men in the world, and the le
idea of imposition would shock his honour, and put an end to my scheme.
Then he is not to know he is to be taken for a woman.
Certainly not—Hush, here he is, now for my credentials.

my maid has just brought them me.
O with what joy I receive them—they are all right?—There will be no mistake I
ope?—Nothing to make me appear ridiculous?—I would not appear ridiculous for the world.
All is right—No, no.
They are addressed to her uncle!
Yes, because it will be far more de
icate to be introduced through his means—
ut there is one enclosed to her.
D'ye think she'll see me?
Yes; I dare say—There is little doubt
f it.
By my dream last night, I'd lay my life he will.
Why, what did you dream?
I dreamt she ordered her servants to drag your Lordship by force out of the house, and duck you in the great fish-pond for a whole hour.
Is that a sign?—
O yes—Dreams always go by contraries.
Going, returns.
But I know she is so haughty and reserved, that,
should
she admit me, I shall appear confused and awkward.—
So much the better—she expects you'll be awkward.
Expects I shall be awkward!
Pshaw, pshaw—Hesitate no longe
with your fears, but away—you know your first court must be to the uncle, and when you hav
been a little time in the house your apprehension will vanish.—Away, away.
But if she should not condescen
to see me?
Oh, my Lord, you may depend upon
she will, because of my dream.

Madam!

Yes—that you do—and a

I am very much obliged to you▪ infinitely obliged to you—I assure you this fav

DON ANTONIO.
Hah!—What! Struggling?
Oh, Uncle, I have been so
used by this Gentleman, that I must beg you
resent his behaviour.
How!
Certainly, my dear, if you
have
used ill.
Most scandalously—Frighten her a

Aside to Antonio.
Upon my honour, Sir—
Zounds, Sir, my niece is one of the
st reserved, prudent young women—and who
ver offers an insult to her, it is my place, and
sistent but with my honour, to resent it.—How
ite she looks.
Aside.
Sir, I shall not draw my sword be

up your's.
And so I will, my poor Lady—I
it has frightened you—Here, Niece, have you

Draws.
She is not in earnest, sure.
Aside.
I have received many a blow from
ady, but never such a one as this!
Do you dare to call me a Lady
n, Sir?
A Lady, oh no—you are a tyge
a fury—
I never met with such usage!—Damnation!
What a profligate she is! I d
not think such a word could come out of a woman mouth!
How, Sir!—Dare to say that aga

Why, what
this about? I won't fight—I only drew

To frighten me!—Did you

Why not? You see I am.
Yes, I see, and scorn you for it.
Why, Uncle, the tables are fa
turned upon you.
Yes, Niece, and I'm much oblig
to you, for your advice in the business—But
may depend upon it, I shall take care h

Going.
Come back, Sir, I insist upon yo
coming back, and recalling what you have sa

What insinuation?—That I think
a female?—I am sure there is no offence

g in the world; what I am never happy with
and what I even make myself poor, de
ed, and ridiculous, in the daily pursuit of.
And pray, Sir, in what, do I ap
like a woman?
And pray, Sir, in what, does any
our modern coxcombs appear like a man?
yet they don't scruple to call themselves
.
Then you will not recall your
iments and beg my pardon?
Beg your pardon?—No—Yes, yes

I'll bear this no longer—Draw.
Marquis draws.
Here Jerome, Jerome, come and
end me, where it would be a dishonour to de
myself.
Enter
JEROME.
See, Jerome, how my life is a

Aye, your Honour, I always tol
you the women would be the death of you
last.
You too, rascal!—
Well, I declare with her sword i
her hand, she is as fine a creature as ever I saw!—Oh you audacious minx.
Scoundrel—
Sure, your Honour, she must be t
Maid of Orleans.
I am no maid, Sir.
I am sorry for your misfortune.
Don Antonio, this treatment
suppose you inflict as a just recompence for
presumption in daring to hope for an alliance
your family, spite of the prejudice which I kn
the Countess had conceived—I cannot deny t
justice of the accusation—I came into he ho
with the vain hope—
By no means
vain
—I am ready
comply, be your hopes what they will.
Can I believe what you say real?
Certainly—Were you going to say
hoped to marry me? If you were, call the
est, and we'll be married immediately.
Aye, if that is what your Lord
p wants, the Priest shall tack you together in
minutes.
This sudden consent staggers me—
was not prepared for it—one likes a little pre
ation before marriage as well as before death.
Aside.
What! you are cast down—
med—want to recant—but I won't let you—
shall
marry me—I insist upon it.
What, directly?
Yes, directly—I am in a hurry.
I believe this is mere trifling—
ar you will marry me
I do swear.
You are witness to the oath.
We are witness.

Has the Marquis more sisters th

No.
Then this, I suppose, is your br

Aye, in womens' clothes—O de
another fine sight!
Oh Heavens, if it is a man, ta

Sister Isabella, when I shall rela

Aye, that it is—Madam, let me

To the Marquis.
Why,
are you—
After trembling as if much terrified
you
a woman?
Countess, I knew you never wo
have consented to have seen the Marquis, had
been introduced into the house as a man, therei
I formed this stratagem, unknown to him,
to bring you together.
To the Countess.
Do not droop,
dearest wife.
And are you really the Marquis?
at a strange blunder have I made!
I am the Marquis—and it shall be
future care to banish for ever from your me

Donna Isabella, we are all infinite

And what vow is that

A vow to LOVE, HONOUR and OBEY.

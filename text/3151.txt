John Durand
.—The Subscriber having from his Infancy endeavoured to qualify himself in the Art of historical Painting, humbly hopes for the Encouragement from the Gentlemen and Ladies of this City and Province, that so elegant and entertaining an Art, has always obtain'd from People of the most improved Minds, and best Taste and Judgement, in all polite Nations in every Age. And tho' he is sensible, that to excel (in this Branch of Painting, especially) requires a more ample Fund of universal and accurate Knowledge than he can pretend to, in Geometry, Geography, Perspective, Anatomy, Expression of Passions, ancient and modern History, &c. &c. Yet he hopes, from the good Nature and Indulgence of the Gentlemen and Ladies who employ him that his humble Attempts, in which his best Endeavours will not be wanting, will meet with Acceptance, and give Satisfaction; and he proposes to work at as cheap Rates as any Person in America.
To such Gentlemen and Ladies as have thought but little upon this Subject, and might only regard painting as a superfluous Ornament, I would just observe, that History-painting, besides being extremely ornamental, has many important uses. It presents to our View, some of the most interesting Scenes recorded in ancient or modern History; gives us more lively and perfect Ideas of the Things represented, than we could receive from an historical account of them; and frequently recals to our Memory, a long Train of Events, with which those Representations were connected. They shew us a proper Expression of the Passions excited by every Event, and have an Effect, the very same in Kind, (but stronger) than a fine historical Description of the same Passage would have upon a judicious Reader. Men who have distinguished themselves for the good of their Country and Mankind, may be set before our Eyes as Examples, and to give us their silent Lessons, and besides, every judicious Friend and Visitant shares with us in the Advantage and Improvement, and increases its Value to ourselves.

The editor and engraver, has taken great pains, and been very exact in laying down these four beautiful prospects, with which the city presents itself to the eye of every judicious Beholder. He hopes to meet with encouragement from all Gentlemen and Ladies, &c. especially, as nothing of this Kind ever has been undertaken before by any body in this part of the world.
Conditions of Subscription.
1. These above-mentioned four different views, with the respective references, in English, High Dutch and Low Dutch will be curiously engraved on a copper plate, of 21 by 12 inches each, and printed on best large paper.
2. A plan of the streets, &c. of this city, with their respective names, will also be neatly engraved on another copper plate, and printed on best large paper.
3. Each subscriber to sign his name, and give his quality and place of abode.
4. These four prints will be delivered on or before the last day of May next, to be several subscribers at their place of abode, at Twenty Shillings, New-York currency; one half to be paid on subscribing, the other half on the delivery of the five prints.
5. The subscription will be closed on the 28th day of May next, after which none will be sold or disposed of.
6. A separate Pamphlet will be published along with the prints, giving an exact account of the wholesome climate, pleasant situations, products, &c. of this province, for the benefit of the subscribers, which they may chuse, either in English, High Dutch, or Low Dutch.
7. The above plates are partly finished engraving. The editor and publisher has settled a correspondence in the most noted cities and towns in New-York government, New-England, the Jersies, and Pennsylvania, for to deliver the prints immediately after publication, whereof notice will be given in the public News-Papers in New-York, Boston, Philadelphia, &c.

P. S. The reason why these above-mentioned four views, with the plans of this city, have not been finished and delivered according to Advertisement, is, 1st. a great many Gentlemen and Ladies, having as yet only promised to subscribe; this my undertaking being of a very extraordinary charge to me. 2d. I find a great deal more land laid in lots additional to this city, than what I was acquainted with, consequently requires more expence and time to complete the same; particularly as I am desirous to give Satisfaction to all those that have, and may encourage the above undertaking, as well as for my recommendation and credit; therefore, all Gentlemen, and others are requested to be expeditious in subscribing, and giving in their names and places of abode as they are intended to be printed, and prefixed to the pamphlet.
And in complying with this request, they will greatly oblige their most obliged humble servant,

Maps of Pennsylvania
&c.—Just published (in Philadelphia) the Second Edition of a Map of Pennsilvania, New-Jersey, New York and the Three Lower Counties on Delaware, By Lewis Evans.
The Determination of the Bounds of Pennsilvania and Maryland, by a Decree in Chancery; a new Purchase made of the Indians and the Erecting of four new Counties in Pennsilvania, since the first Publication of the Map, have made this Edition necessary. And Care has been taken to supply the Omissions, and to rectify the Errors which have escaped in the former Impression; and the South Side of Lake Ontario is now added.
The several Provinces and Counties are distinguished in the plain Maps by Division of Lines, and in the Colour'd Ones, by different Colours.
Besides what are Common to other Maps, as the Sea-Coast, Rivers, Creeks, Mountains, Roads, intermediate Distances of Places, and the Situation of Cities, Towns, Villages, &c. there are inserted in this, how far the Tide runs up the Rivers, and the Time of the High-Water, full and Change, of the greatest Use in Commerce: the Variation of the Needle, by several accurate Observations, and the Rate of its Decrease, of Use in adjusting old Surveys of Land; the greatest Length of Days and Nights, a Table of the Distances between the most considerable Towns, besides Barometrical and Thermometrical Observations, Accounts of the Weather in this Climate, the Production of Lighting and Fogs accounted for: with several other Articles recommended by the Curious to the Enquiry of the Travellers.
The Smallness of this Map has been very often objected to the Author; but if Gentlemen would consider, that they seldom have seen Maps of any Parts of Europe to a larger Scale, and that there is not a City, Town, or even a Village of six Houses within the Compass of the Map, that there are not inserted in it, and that Pensilvania, as far as tolerably settled, which is between Delaware River, the Lower Counties, Mariland, and the Kittatinny Mountains, tho' now divided into eight Counties, is not of Extent equal to Yorkshire in South-Britain, they would be induced to think a larger Map impertinent; if they did not expect it for other Uses then Geography, Physics, History and Commerce.
The Price of the Plain Maps is One Spanish Dollar; of the colour'd Ones, on superfine Writing paper, Two Dollars; and there are a few on fine Calico, at a Dollar and a Half each.
In Justice to the Buyers of the former Impression, their colour'd Maps, tho torn or defaced will be exchanged for the new Edition at Five Shillings, and their plain Ones at two Shillings and Six-pence.
To be sold or exchanged by the Author in Philadelphia, and by the Printer hereof.—

Simeon Cooley
.—The Conduct of Simeon Cooley, in his daring Infractions of the Non-importation Agreement; his insolent and futile Defence of those inglorious Measures; with his avowed Resolution obstinately to persevere in counteracting the legal Efforts of a brave and free People in support of their inestimable Rights ‘alarmed and insenced’ the Inhabitants of this City, who dreading the destructive Consequence that might have ensued from so dangerous an Example, determined, at a General Meeting held on Friday Evening last, to call the said Cooley to Account; and prevail on him, If Possible, to desist from his vile Practices, and endeavour to bring him to such Concessions as should to them appear best calculated to attone for his repeated and unprecedented offences. Two Gentlemen were appointed to inform him of the Sentiments of the Inhabitants, who required his immediate Attendance at their Place of Meeting, and to assure him that no injury should be offered to his Person; (to prevent which, every imaginable Precaution was taken) but Cooley, (influenced perhaps by some ill-disposed and Stupid Adviser) refused to attend the Place appointed, and alledged in Excuse for his Non-attendance, ‘that he did not think it consistent with his personal Safety to meet them There’, at the same Time he expressed a Willingness to make the Concessions required, from his Parlour Window. When the Inhabitants received this disagreeable Intelligence, they immediately proceeded towards his House; but Cooley, apprized of their coming, thought proper to decamp, accompanied by a Military Gentleman, (who covered his Retreat) sought for a Sanctuary within the Fort Walls, which could afford him but an indifferent Protection against the keen Reproaches of a guilty Conscience, the only Punishment he had to dread. Whilst the Inhabitants were assembled in the Fields, M—r P—r ordered a File of Soldiers to guard his (Cooley's) House, who were accordingly drawn up before his Door, with their Musquets loaded, &c. Whether the Author of this unwarrantable Step, designed a compliment to the Magistracy and Inhabitants of this City, or to recommend himself to his Superiors by his officious and blundering Zeal, is unknown: but 'tis more than probable, that his precipitate Conduct was disapproved of by the latter,...
On Saturday Morning, Cooley consented to meet the Inhabitants; and Four in the Afternoon being the Time appointed, and the Merchants's Coffee-House the Place, they assembled in Expectation of this Important Event; but the Majority thinking it a very unsuitable Place for the Purpose, required his appearance in the Fields, where he attended, and publickly acknowledged his Crimes; implored the Pardon of his Fellow Citizens; engaged to store an equivalent to the Goods he had sold, together with all that he had in Possession that were imported contrary to Agreement; and so to conduct for the future as not to render himself obnoxious to the Contempt and just Resentment of an injured People.—News item in

Benjamin Halsted
.—Having been informed that a defamatory Advertisement, against me signed by one Andrew Bowne, of Shrewsbury, was intended to be published in the Thursday's Gazette; This is to desire the Public not to suffer themselves to be seduced by the Malice of the said Andrew Bowne, but to suspend their Judgement, until, either the Truth, or the Calumny of his Assertion, be properly determined by a due Course of Law; for I am resolved to sue him immediately for Scandal. Benjamin Halsted.—
The New-York Gazette or the Weekly Post Boy
, August 23, 1764.
Benjamin Halsted
.—The Subscriber finds himself obliged, with infinite Reluctance, to address the Public on Account of a surrilous Advertisement in the New-York Gazette of Thursday last Week, signed by one Andrew Bowne. The Character and Reputation of a Man in Trade, being of the most delicate and tender Nature, any Attempts to stigmatize it, not founded on Facts, or supported by Evidence, will never, I flatter myself, influence the impartial Part of Mankind, before the Truth has been scrutinized in a legal Manner. But, some Time must elapse before this can be done: And as the Audaciousness of the Advertisement may make impressions to my Prejudice, I shall endeavour to remove them, by laying all my Transactions with Bowne, open to the Public; where by it may easily be perceived the Means by which his Brain was so violently heated as to overcome his reason.
Andrew Bowne, of Shrewsbury, called on me last Summer, telling me Joseph Holmes, of this City, had recommended me to him as an honest Silversmith. He then bespoke a Set of Silver Buttons for a Suit of Clothes. They were made exactly to his Directions; and when he came to fetch them he seemed perfectly pleased with them. Three Weeks afterwards he called on me, and desired I would take them back. I represented to him how unsaleable Things made after another's Whim were; and that before I found a Person of his Taste, Years might elapse. He then offered me a Dollar; which I refusing he grew passionate, and went away in the greatest Anger. On his Return Home, he wrote me the Annexed Letter (No. 1) which I despised, and returned no answer to. Last May he wrote me another (No. 2) in both which he has been very lavish of Names that no honest Man can well brook. I returned him an Answer (No. 3) with a View to pass the Affair into Ridicule; but it had a contrary Effect; and the Advertisement in Question was produced by it.
Private Affairs, of a trivial and insignificant Nature, are unworthy of the Attention of the Public. But when malicious Defamation is allowed to blast Characters in a public Newspaper, a justification in the same public Manner becomes necessary; This Apology, I hope, will plead my Excuse.

There is a Spring in the Inside of the Fusee, which I call a Secondary Main Spring; This Spring is always kept stretched to a certain Tension by the Main-spring, and during the Time of winding up The Time-Keeper, at which Time the Main-Spring is not suffered to act, this Secondary Spring Supplies its place...—

A Proposal for Heating House of Public Worship

As there is at present a View for one or more Buildings going on for publick Worship, and as the Weather is so severe in the Winter Season, I wonder it has never been put in practice at the Beginning of such publick Buildings, (when it makes so little difference in the Expence) in making hollow Wells, or Flews with a Furnace, or Stoke-Hole at each Side of (Church or Meeting) at Entrance, when the Congregation by a small Subscription, or otherwise, at the severe Time of the Winter, might keep the Building to any degree of Heat, which would be found very agreeable to Persons of all Ranks, and with a small Quantity of Fuel, either Wood or Coals, properly apply'd; (the Trouble or Expence being a meer Trifle, by known Experience)....—

Trinity Church Steeple

A noble Motion indeed, and if carried into Execution with any Spirit, will give an Ornament to the City few others can boast of; and 'tis surprizing a thing of the Kind has been so long neglected, unless, indeed they were frightned out of it by the loss of the first Set sent for, which Barbados now glories in; and which was taken by the Enemy, retaken, and sent in there. Philadelphia vaunts in theirs of a Ring of Eight, in a Steeple not so substantial, and it was chearfully carried through after the first Motion. It is doubted but the Generality of the People of all Denominations will approve of it here.—News item in

Daniel Dood
of Newark in New-Jersey Surveyor, designs to move to another Place and therefore gives publick Notice in his own Stile of Poetry, Viz.
Let this give Notice to my Friends,
That I am about to move,
To try to better my Condition
As it doth me behove
And if that any want that I
Should Land for them survey,
Let them apply themselves to me
Before I go away:
But with this Caution well observe
They don't infringe the Claim
Of them, that Seven hold for One,
And think it is no Shame;
Who say I help to steal Man's Land,
And blame me very sore
Which Blame of right belongs to them
That stole it long before.
But I'm unwilling to offend
Those Fools as well as Wise,
These Fools I say all those are Fools
Whose Interest blinds their Eyes.
If any are displeased herewith
or with that Path I've Trod,
The Auther will maintain the same,
Whose Name is Daniel Dod.

.—..Said [George] Ball has likewise imported a large assortment of the useful and wholesome iron utensils, so much recommended by physicians for their safety, and so generally and justly prefered to copper, by all the house keepers in England, for two of the best reasons in the world, viz. That they are entirely free from that dangerous, poisonous property, from whence so many fatal accidents have been known to arise amongst those who use copper vessels, and because they never want tinning as copper vessels do.
Tea kettles from three quarts to six, Four gallon pots with covers, to five quarts, Pie pans, two gallon oval pots, Stew pans and covers, of several different sizes, Fish kettles of six different sizes, with strainers, Sauce pans, from six quarts to one pint. For cabin use on board of shipping, they are far preferable to copper, as no danger (however careless the cook, or long the voyage) can possibly happen from using them, as too often has through those causes, from the use of copper. They are all wrought according to the most approved patterns now used in London, and will be sold very low.—

It has been 6 weeks on the Grass, and the Bleacher says it must be in his Hands 6 more, before it will be well whiten'd; for that he never saw a Piece equal to it, and desired to know of what Fabrick it was.

Needlework
.—...But my Wife's notion of education differ widely from mine. She is an irreconcileable enemy to Idleness, and considers every State of life as Idleness, in which the hands are not employed or some art acquired, by which she thinks money may be got or saved.
In pursuance of this principle, she calls up her Daughters at a certain hour, and appoints them a task of needle-work to be performed before breakfast....
By this continual exercise of their diligence, she has obtained a very considerable number of labourious performances. We have twice as many fire-skreens as chimneys and three flourished quilts for every bed. Half the rooms are adorned with a kind of futile pictures which imitate tapestry. But all their work is not set out to shew; she has boxes fill with knit garters and braided shoes. She has twenty coverns for side-saddles embroidered with silver flowers, and has curtains wrought with gold in various figures, which she resolves some time or other to hang up.
About a month ago, Tent and Turkey-stitch seemed at a stand; my Wife knew not what new Work to introduce; I ventured to propose that the Girls should now learn to read and write, and mentioned the necessity of a little arthmetick; but, unhappily, my Wife has discovered that linen wears out, and has bought the Girls three little wheels, that they may spin hukkaback for the servants table. I remonstrated, that with larger wheels they might dispatch in a hour, what must now cost them a day; but she told me, with irresistable authority, that any business is better than Idleness; that when these wheels are set upon a table, with mats under them, they will turn without noise, and keep the Girls upright; that great wheels are not fit for Gentlewomen; and that with these, small as they are, she does not doubt but that the three Girls, if they are kept close, will spin every year as much cloth as would cost five pounds, if one was to buy it.—A letter to the Printer in

Water Works
.—Mr. Parker, As no doubt you'll advertise the Readers of your weekly Paper of the late Fire in the South Ward of this City; please to add those few Hints, for our future Safety.
It is well known, that the Fires in this Town of late, as that in Duke Street, the School House, and This, happen'd to be situate within Reach of the Rivers; by which Means, the engines could be supplied without great Difficulty; and thus, to our happy Deliverances, those raging Fires were extinguished.
But suppose a fire should come to a Head, as either of those did, in the Heart of our City, how should we master it?...I propose that a Drain, or Brick Channel, may be carried up at Low-Water Mark, from under the Long-Bridge, in Broad-Street;...Some may object perhaps, that such a Course of Salt Water will spoil the Wells near it, and make the Water brackish; even this I question, as it is confined in a Brick Channel; and if it should, Tea-Water is daily brought at the Doors, and the other will do to wash their Houses.—Letter to the printer in

And as he finishes all carriages whatever in his own shop without applying to any other, He is likewise determined to make them as good, sell them as cheap, and be as expeditious as there is a posibility. And to convince the public of the truth of what he asserts, he will make any piece of work that is required, equal to any imported from England, and will sell it at the prime cost of that imported, by which means those who are pleased to favour him with their custom will save the freight, insurance, and expences naturally attending in putting the carriages to rights after they arrive. And as a further inducement, he will engage his work for a year after it is delivered, that is, if any part gives way or fails by fair usage, he will make it good at his own expence. Those advantages cannot be obtained on carriages imported. He has now a considerable stock of the best of all materials fit for making carriages. For the above reasons, he most humbly requests the encouragement of the public, which will be most gratefully acknowledged by him.

The Motto being, Tandem vincitur, seems to declare the Virtue, Perseverance, Magnanimity and Success of the Morris Family, against all such combined Force;...—Letter to the printer in

Philosophical Optical Machine
.—To the Publick in general here and hereabouts. Ladies, Gentlemen and every Body else, I am well enough know to all of you, for I am a New-Yorker. I don't pretend to be a fine Scribe; far from it. I have been otherwise employed all my Days, than to have any Time to learn a knack of writing well; but yet I think I am not quite so unlearned, but that I can write so as to be understood; and as I find myself under a Necessity of making my address to you, I hope you will make an Allowance for my manner and Stile.
You all know I lately purchased, and many of you have seen my Philosophical Optical Machine, lately invented in, and imported from London. I have hitherto shewed (out of near 100 Prospects) only two Setts, 8 in each of English Palaces, grand Building, and Gardens, &c. Every one who has seen them, has paid me Four Shillings a Piece for each Set; and I must say, they have gone from me well satisfied; their repeated Visits and constant Recommendations of the Machine, convince me of what I assert.
But tho' all my Customers seem well pleased (except a very few who can approve of Nothing they see others do, or with any Thing but what they say themselves or have a Hand in) yet as I understood, there were great Numbers who think much of Four Shillings, and knowing that there are others who really can't afford it, I began last week to show for Two Shillings only, the first eight English Prospects; and determined to have shewn them no more here. But last Week having been so bad weather, for the most Part, that few People cared to stir Abroad, I hereby give Notice, that none may miss an Opportunity of seeing the English Prospects, that every Morning this Week I will continue to shew the first 8, and every Afternoon and Evening, the other 8 of them, to no less than 6 Persons at a Time; but if a lesser Number should come, I will leave it to their own Generosity, according to the Satisfaction they think they receive. The next Monday I will begin to show, on the same easy Terms, nine of the French King's Palaces, and so every succeeding Week different Ones, in different Parts of the World, till the whole be gone through. After that, I intend to go to Philadelphia....Jo.

Mr. [Charles Willson] Peale
is much indebted to the very ingenious inventor of the new lamps, for the brillancy of his evening exhibitions. The first of this curious sort of lamps (which in burning consumes the smoke) was brought to this city by his excellency doctor Franklin from which Mr. Peale has lamps, made here, as follows, viz. eight lamps with treble tubes; three large single lamps, and two of a smaller size; which, at a very moderate calculation, give more light than 200 candles would. This may serve to shew the great utility of such lamps where much light is wanting.—

Peale's Museum
.—The Bow. An African Prince subdued in battle, capitulated for his bow and quiver—a bauble bought his life. A British merchant sent him to South-Carolina, where he was used as a slave. A placid countenance, and submissive manners, marked his resignation; and preserved him in all situations, the possession of his arms—the only companions he had left—the sole objects of his affections. His stateliness and strength recommended him to Colonel Mott, a humane master, in whose service he died, in steadfast faith of a certain resurrection in his native state.
The bow and quiver were preserved as relics of a faithful slave, in the Colonel's family, who gratefully remember the services, the fortitude, and the fidelity of the trusty, the gentle Iambo.
In the campaign of 1781, the widow of Colonel Mott, (who died a patriot) was banished from her house, on the river Congaree, then fortified by a British garrison; the garrison was besieged by a small detachment from the American army, whose approaches were soon within bow-shot. The widow, who lived in a cottage in sight of the fort, was informed that the preservation of her house was the only impediment to its reduction—and she was informed of the expedients proposed. Here, said she, (presenting the African bow and quiveri) are the materials—Iambo never used these arrows and I fear they are poisoned; use them not, therefore, ever against your enemies—but take the bow, any arrow will waft the match. Spare not the house, so you expel the foe. The blazing roof prduced submission—the Britons dropped their arms—the Americans entered the house, and both joined to extinquish the flames.
The misfortunes of a Prince, and the heroism of a lady, are not uncommon—the novelty is the Bow—a stem of genuine bamboo—which, destined for the defence of Liberty in Africa, served the same cause in America, was preserved by an officer of the patriot army—presented to Mr. Peale and is not deposited in his museum.—

He however hopes they will no longer be discourage on his head when they are assured there is scarcely any thing altho otherwise seemingly insignificant, but what may be valuable to such a collection, from the smallest article to the greatest that is new uncommon or curious.
He especially wishes to collect into one view, specimens of various kinds of wood growing in America, they may be in cubes of two or three inches; all sort of fossils, minerals spares, stone, sand, clay, marble, and earthly substances; from a better knowledge whereof the arts will derive improvement, especially in the manufacturing of Porcelaine, earthen, and stone wares, and in the various useful metals.
It will always be acceptable to have some account (if known) where they grow, or where found and whether alone, or with but a few, or with appearances of their being in large quantities, and with any particular circumstances, that may attend them. Besides the above particular subjects, curiosities or rare things of every other kind are desirable: birds, beasts, reptiles, insects alive or dead, tools, dresses, utensils, or other articles heretofore, or at present in use among the Indians of America. One or more of their clay or stone pots are particularly desired.
If numbers of the articles are collected in the museum, a part of them will be exchanged with the proprietors of other Collections, for our information.
It will be obliging in the Printers, friends of science, in the other states as well as this, if they will give the above a place in their newspapers. Mr. Peale respectfully invites them to view his museum and will be happy to see them when they visit Philadelphia.—

Peal Proprietor of the Philadelphia Museum, in the twentieth year of his age. America has cause to mourn her loss in the death of this amiable youth. His genius as a naturalist had already displayed itself in an eminent degree; he was preparing to explore our Western World and South America to collect and preserve subjects of natural history, and had it been the will of the Supreme Disposer of all things to have continued him on the theatre of action; there was every prospect of his having acted a part that would have done honor to himself and his country.—

John Trumbull
.—Interesting information for the Admirers and Patrons of the Fine Arts in America, respecting Mr. Trumbull's Historical Paintings.
Mr. Trumbull, who lately returned from Europe, proposes to describe in a series of Paintings, the most remarkable events of the late American Revolution. He has in contemplation the following subjects, viz.
I The Death of Warren at the Battle of Bunker's Hill.
II The Death of Montgomery in the Attack of Quebec.
III The Congress of 1776 in the Declaration of Independence.
IV The Surrender of the Hessians at Trenton.
V The Death of Mercer at the Battle of Princeton.
VI The Surrender of Burgoyne at Saratoga.
VII The Treaty with France.
VIII The Surrender of Lord Cornwallis at York Town.
IX The Signing of the Treaty of Peace.
X The Evacuation of New-York by the British 1783.
XI The Resignation of Gen. Washington.
XII The President received by the Ladies of Trenton at the Triumphal Arch.
XIII The Inauguration of the President.
The Portraits of the principal actors in these great scenes will be preserved; and Prints will be published of the whole. The two first of these Subjects are finished; and the Paintings in the hands of eminent Engravers in Europe. Four others are commenced some of which are half completed. These, with the remainder of the work, if prosecuted, will require many years of application, and a very considerable expence.—It is now to be decided, whether Mr. Trumbull will meet with such Patronage in America as will justify him in involving himself in such considerable expences of Time and Money; or whether he will be obliged to relinquish a favorite undertaking and return to Europe: where Subjects of a different nature and more interesting to the feelings of the People of that Continent, will ensure him employment in a more profitable, though less agreeable manner. We understand that the Engravings are to be published in numbers, containing two each: The price will be three Guineas for every Print; and, we are told, a subscription for the purpose is soon to be opened.—

John Trumbull
.—Extracts of a letter from New York, February 27. The justly celebrated Trumbull is now busily engaged in his great undertaking—the productions you may depend will be a most valuable acquisition to the world—to the American world in particular. I have seen some of the pieces in which a few heads and some portraits are finished—the likeness are perfect—the drawing, Nature Itself—and the designs sentimental, elevated and just. In short, here is no risque—the object is sure, and the mind is perfectly satisfied—it rests in the execution. (Mass. Gen.)
Fir'd with the martial toils that bath'd in gore
His brave companions, on his native shore,
Trumbull, with daring hand, the scene recalls,
And shades with night Quebec's beleaguer'd walls,
Mid flashing flames that round the turret rise,
Blind carnage raves, and great Montgomery dies.
On Charlestown's heights, thro' floods of rolling fire,
Brave Warren falls, and sullen hosts retire;
While other plains of death that gloom the skies,
And chiefs immorotal o'er his canvas rise.

John Trumbull
.—The President's Portrait, Is finished by Trumbull and a fine thing it is; designed and executed in his superior style of excellence. It is full length, in his uniform of blue and buff—boots and spurs—head uncovered, most nobly relieved, in contrast with a luminous cloud and fine light sky—nearly a front psition, with his right hand and arm thrown on the saddle of an elegant white horse, with inimitable ease—the beast in the action of biting the middle joint of his near foreleg—this position of the horse shows his neck to great advantage, while it leave the President's head as it ought to be, the most conspicuous object in the picture. There are distant prospects of particular interesting scenes, as accompaniments. The whole piece is designed to convey to posterity an idea of The Man, at the most interesting period, when he finished his career of military glory—the evacuation of New York. It is therefore a warm, and highly animated business in every respect.—

Transparent Paintings
at the Theatre, last tuesday, on the celebration of our Independence, gave such infinite satisfaction, that a description of them, we apprehend, will be pleasing to many of our readers. On each side of the Gateway were two superb Pillars, twenty feet in height, adorned with wreaths of Flowers; on the Pedestal to the right were three Wheat Sheafs, emblematical of Plenty; on the left a ship under full sail, with Thirteen Stripes Flying, emblem of Commerce; a grand Obelisk in the Centre on the top of which burnt a lambent flame over the ever-to-be remembered Names of the Heroes who bravely fell in defence of their Country. Warren, Montgomery, Mercer, Wooster, &c. The names of living Worthies, Washington, Green, Wayne, Knox, &c. Graced the other part, under the Emblem of the Cincinnati, `The Bald Eagle', with the Sword of Justice in one Talon, and a Thunderbolt in the other; the words Independence and Liberty issuing from its Beak. This was supported by two Figures, representing Peace with the Insignia of a Plough and Liberty with her Cap. The whole ornamented with Trophies, &c. &c. in a most pleasing and elegant style, drew together an innumerable crowd of Citizens of all denominations, expressing the highest approbation.—

The Transparent Paintings
exhibited in various parts of the city, on Thuirsday evening, were equal at least, to anything of the kind ever before seen in America.
That displayed before the Fort at the bottom of Broad-way, did great honor to its inventors and executors for the ingenuity of the design and goodnss of the workmanship; it was finely lighted and advantageously situated; the virtues Fortitude, Justice and Wisdom were judiciously applied; of the first, all America has had the fullest evidence; and with respect to the two others, who does not entertain the most pleasing anticipation. The President. The Senate. The Representatives of the United States.
His Excellency Don Gardoqui's residence next caught the eye and fixed it in pleasing contemplation: The Tout-ensemble here, formed a most brilliant front; the figures were fancied, The Graces, suggested the best ideas; and the pleasing variety of emblems, flowers, shrubery, arches &c. and above all the Moving Pictures, that figured in the windows, or as it were in the background, created by fixing the transparencies between the windows, afforded a new animated and enchanting spectacle.
The residence of his Excellency, Count Moustier, was illuminated in a stile of novel elegance; the splendid bordering of lamps round the windows; and above all the large designs in front, the allusions, of which we cannot at present particularly describe, did great honor to the taste and sentiment of the inventor.
The above two instances of attention to honor this great and important occasion, so highly interesting to our `dear country' evince the friendship, the delicacy and politeness of our illustrious allies.
The portrait of `The Father of His Country' exhibited in Broad-Street, was extremely well executed, and had a fine effect.
There was an excellent Transparency, also shewn at the Theatre, and at the corner, near the Fly-Market: In short, emulation and ingenuity were alive; but perhaps were in no instance exhibited to greater advantage than in the display of the Fire Works, which formed one novelty to another, continued for two hours, to surprize, by variety, taste and brilliancy.
The illumination of the Federal State House, was among the most agreeable of the exhibitions of the evening; and the ship Carolina formed a beautiful pyramid of stars: The evening was fine—the company innumerable—every one appeared to enjoy the scene, and no accident casts the smallest cloud upon the retrospect.—

[Jean Antoine] Houdon
, A french sculptor of eminence, has lately finished a very fine bust of General Washington. To be enabled to execute the likeness, the artist went to Philadlephia, and lived six months in Washington's family. The character and attitude of the founder and defender of American liberty, of the representative of a happy and peaceful nation, of the protector of agriculture, that abundant source of national wealth, are happily imagined, and as happily executed in his performance. It was particularly this last mentioned character, the agriculture, that Houdon had in view. The simple costume of the figure, expressly chosen with view, has been much criticised in America, where taste is yet in its infancy. The Americans wished to contemplate a Roman hero decorated with all the attributes of a conqueror whereas Houdon, on the contrary, aimed to represent the protector of the arts, of peace and liberty. It was the interposition of Washington himself which decided in the general assembly the execution of the artists ideas. The figure is arrayed in the simple and noble dress of a man in rural life, a light plaited vest half buttoned, sandals on his feet, with a cloak, fastened on his breast, and flowing over his shoulders and back, suited to protect an agricultor from the inclemency of the weather. One hand is supported by a staff; the rest on the republican fasces crowned with a cap of liberty, At his feet is a plough.—

Mr. Daniel N. Train
, a young gentleman of genius and abilities, late a pupil of Rush, the famous Carver of Philadelphia, some time since arrived in this City, has lately completed the ornaments of the Ship Adams', soon to be launched at the Walabought, Long Island.
The following is a sketch of these ornaments: On the head of the ship is a figure of the President, represented in the attitude of addressing both Houses of Congress. In his left hand is a scroll, supposed to be his address—his right is raised in a spirited position, as if in the act of bidding defiance to the enemies of America. At his side, is a branch of oak, springing from a rock, emblematic of his firmness and patriotic virtues, in support of the rights of his country. On the stern, in the center of the Taffrail, are the arms of the United States, supported by Sybele and Neptune—the latter with his left hand resting on his Trident, and his right extended over our `Infant Navy,' with some attributes of Commerce. The former reclining on a sheaf of wheat, with a Scepter in her right hand—in the left is the Key of the Earth and supporting a Cornucopia—At her side is a Youth with the Emblems of Agriculture, offering its productions for the support of the United States.
The ornamental part of this vessel exhibits a striking proof of Mr. Train's abilities. We wish him success in the Carvings for the `44,' now building at Corlaers Hook which we are told, he is engaged to execute.—

[John Francis?] Renault, Senior
.—Prospectus of an Allegorical Picture, or the Triumph of Liberty, This picture is proposed to be 21 inches by 16. In the right of the picture is ghe Goddess of Liberty rising to the skies on an Obelisk, presenting a crown, to which all the heroes filled with her sublime sentiments are worthy to aspire.
The Book of the Law is supported by a cube of the Obelisk pointing to the solididy of that moral, `The Rights of Man.'
On the side is little Genie presenting to view, the Marseilles Hymn: On one of the steps of this monument is an urn containing the ashes of John James Rousseau. At a little distance is the three Divinities accompanied by Liberty, (namely Justice, holding the Scales and Sword, Peace, presenting an olive branch, and plenty, with a horn full of fruit, an emblematical presage of the happiness of the people,) she burns crowns, sceptres, crosses of St. Louis spears and titles of nobility, cemented and writ with the blood of the human race.
On the other side of the Obelisk are the kings, who are inimical to Liberty; they have all a particular expression of countenance, that indicates the rage and despair that rankles in their hearts, one appears to be on the point of throwing himself headlong down a precipice, another on the earth, a third just going to stab himself, having the different passions of grief, rage and despair strongly depicted in his countenance; and near them is a Queen, who by the expression of her eyes visibly discovers the rage with which her spirits are agitated.
In the left is a grand tomb, enclosing the names of those American Heroes, who have served and died in defence of Liberty and their country, such as Franklin, Warren, Montgomery, Laurens, Sullivan, Putnam, Scamell, Barber, Mercer, Wooster, Poor and Lee, near which is the Genius of the country, in the habit and helmet of Minerva, bearing the colours of the Nation, and at her side an Eagle, emblematical of America; incense is continually burning at the foot of the tomb, where a Priest is discovered singing Hymns in praise of these illustrious Heroes, At the bottom of the picture is a seven headed Hydra, or Despotism tumbling into ruins.
Dedicated to the friends of Liberty, by Renault, sen. author of the Work.
I the undersigned having taken all the necessary steps for the engraving, paper and printing of the impression of the Picture of the Triumph of Liberty in conjunction with Mr. Renault, sen.

Counterfeiting
.—The citizens are cautioned against the impositors of villains who are passing counterfeit Five Shillings Bills. The paper is of a darker colour than the true bills; The types are old, and not well printed. It is a misfortune that we have two kinds of genuine five shilling bills. The counterfeits are in imitation of those which have a heavy bordering. They may easily be detected, by observing that the eagle on the globe, in the state arms, in the counterfeits, is badly imitated, the wing extending towards the figure of liberty is too large; and the other very short and small: and the globe on which the eagle stands is too large and black. In the body of the true bills, in the words FIVE, the V is smaller than the other letters, and the word appears crooked. In the bordering of the true bills the FIVE SHILLINGS at the end to the right are irregular and incline to the left; in the counterfeits, these words are more erect, and the letters closer together, large and very pale. The signing is not well done, and the bad bills are something larger and wider than the true ones.—

American Landscapes
.—The public are respectfully solicited to inspect the following drawings already executed for the above work.
Mount Vernon, Passaic Falls, Brandywine Mills, Federal City, Annapolis in Maryland. The three former at the Apollo Warehouse No 58 Maiden Lane, New York and the remaining at Mr. Parkyn's Brooklyn, Long Island.
The Proprietors take the earliest opportunity of announcing to the subscribers, that in consequence of a late necessary arrangement, the plate intended to have been delivered this day, will not appear until the third in succession. The plate of the Federal City, nearly completed, and from whence the descriptive tour commences, it is judged expedient should be first published. Although many circumstances inseparable from the establishment of so extensive an undertaking, the first of its kind in America, have unavoidably arisen, hitherto to retard its commencement; yet it is presumed the selection of objects, the attention bestowed in finishing the drawings with neatness, and accuracy, the tedious difficult executions of plates of such large dimensions together with an ardent desire to render the work compleat, will rescue the publishers from the censure of unnecessary delay; whose only wish is to gratify the admirers of picturesque nature and whose ultimate object will be, not only to interest the United States, but the European world, by a general display of those captivating, elegant scenes, which are so profusely distributed over the American continent. The following Drawings are in a state of forwardness. The City of New York, The City of Philadelphia. These are to be followed by Bethlehem in Pennsylvania, View of the North River, View in Connecticut, View in Rhode-Island the second selection of twelve, to compleat the series of twenty-four, will, amongst others contain, Port and town of Boston in Massachusetts, Charlestown South Carolina, &c. &c. Subscription continue to be received by James Harrison at the Apollo Warehouse.—

Van Voorhis, Bayley and Coley
, Real Manufacturers in Gold, Silver, Jewellery, &c. at No. 27, Hanover-Square. Beg leave to inform the public in general, that they have commenced business very extensively in the above Branches. They have procured the best Workmen from Europe, and flatter themselves that the Goods they manufacture will be sold on much lower Terms than those imported, and will be found equal in point of Workmanship.
They have also imported directly from the Manufacturers, a great variety of Plated Goods and Hardware, which will be disposed of on very low Terms for Cash. Also, just arrived, Vestris' Girdles for ladies, elegantly ornamented. Cash, or Goods in exchange, given for Old Sil Mr. Montgomery, where a specimen of his performance may be seen, and their work executed and returned in eight days after application.
As Reynolds has had the honor of working for some of the first characters in America, and been happy enough to gain their approbation, he will therefore submit his pretensions to favor and encouragement to the taste and judgement of a discerning public.
Coat of Arms Being used to distinquish the different families of a country from one another, even when they are of the same name: it is obvious, that in this new and rising empire, they may be made subservient to the valuable purpose of ascertaining descents, perpetuating the memorial of kindred by marriage, and pointing to the various branches of the same family. To obviate the necessity gentlemen are frequently under in this country of sending to Europe for their family coats of arms, which is attended with considerable expence and trouble; the subscriber has been induced to provide himself, at much cost and pains, with a curious collection of books of heraldry, &c. containing upwards of seventy thousand coats of arms, he therefore proposes to furnish those who may be pleased to apply to him, with their arms truly blazoned, at two dollars each. The subscriber intends registering the names, places of residence, &c. of every person applying to him for his arms, together with the arms which shall appear to belong to such person, in a book that will be provided for that purpose, which shall be deposited in the library of this city, as public property. Gentlemen already in possession of their arms, may have them registered on paying one dollar. If the arms required should not be found nothing will be demanded for the search.
Coats of arms, crests, cyphers, and all sorts of devices cut on stone; likewise all sorts of state and public seals cut on brass &c. A generous price will be given for books of heraldry. Thomas Reynolds. Orders are also received by Mr. Lamont, at the Intelligence-Office, opposite the Coffee-House.—

Upon the Manufacture of Glass
. Bottles, black or green, are the most simple of all glass manufacture—the profits in making which depends upon the greatest number of workmen being employed at the smallest expense of fuel. From eight to sixteen blowers can work all at once, at one melting furnace, six feet diameter, which will take six cords of wood every twenty four hours. The best constructed green glass furnace in this country is in New Jersey—where the whole business of smelting, blowing, and cooling is done with one fire, by the particular construction of the furnace.
White glass may also be made in the same furnace: but it is much more curious in its composition; for to make it white, it must partake of all the colours—for this reason—in smelting the purest materials, they naturally have a greenish and purplish tinge; to dislodge which a blackish fossil substance is made use of—upon this principle, that one colour in glass making will destroy another; so that at last a beautiful glass is produced called white; but like the christaline humor of the eye, it partakes of all the colours, as may be seen in the best English white glass which has a changeableness like soap bubbles; but in the best London crown glass, or mirrours, you will not perceive any of that sparkling, changeable power, because it would destort the object seen through or reflected, on account of the refracting power of such glass; therefore this glass is made of pure salts and sands only and has a native greyish colour, as may be seen by the broken pieces that, like water, they may reflect the objects truly.
Crown glass may be made here to greater profit than any other glass—on account of the plenty and cheapness of materials—the quantity that can be made—and the great consumption of it—The method of making which—form and deimensions of the furnace—preparation of the materials—I shall waive for particular reasons.

Lamps
.—A Cheap Light, Just unpacked an assortment of Genuine air-tight Agitable Lamps, for sale at No. 169, Pearl-street nearly opposite the U.S. Bank by John J. Staples & son.
These lamps are well worth the attention of every consumer of candles, as they give a much better light at less than half the expence.
The peculiar advantage of this invention is, that it entirely removes the original objection to lamps, which was the great inconvenience of spilling oil; but it is curious in these, that in the most violent motion held horizontal, or even inverted, the oil cannot escape, and by their being made air tight, the oil (like the quick-silver in a weather glass) is defended from the pressure of the atmosphere, which as well as preventing its coagulating, causes it to slip much lighter and further to the burners, burn brighter, and if properly trimmed with fresh cotton and fine oil, will not want snuffing while burning through twelve or fourteen hours continuance.
They will not only give as much clear light and less smoke than candles, but are cleaner and safer, which makes them fit for parlours, bed-chambers, halls, stair cases, and extremely useful for kitchens, stores manufactories, and on board ship. Their simplicity, and easy manner of trimming, and particularly the small quantity of oil they burn, renders it an object universally to be adopted for every place where light is required.—

Mr. Greenleaf, as agent to the firm, will pay the strictest attention to all orders he may receive from the several cities and towns in this & the neigbouring states. Persons who find it most convenient to send their orders, may rely on their being treated with the same faithfulness as though the applications were personal.
Should any one wish for a parcel from original or fancy patterns, by giving notice to Mr. Greenleaf they could be supplied in a short time.
The progress of manufactures, in our youthful country, affords a flattering presage of expeditious maturity—nothing is wanting but the encouragement of well wishers to their country, in promoting them; and it is in general conceeded, that they are at least as cheap, and equal in goodness to the foreign.

Said Greenleaf is agent to the Manufacturers, and sells at the same rates as at the manufatory, he can always supply deficient pieces, when a purchasers quantity is too small, and will take back a piece or two, if whole or undamaged, where the quantity is too great. There are upwards of 60 different patterns from which every taste may be suited. Elegant plain, patch and festoon Borders.—

Having served his apprenticeship in London, and afterwards wrought with the most eminent in his line there, and in Dublin; and in the latter place for seven years carried on business on his own account, in the course of which he has been employed in making time pieces for astronomical observations, Airometers for shewing the point of the wind, and the Clocks for the principal part of all the public buildings; so that his experience gives him confidence to assert, that with his strict attention, he will execute every command in his line of business in the best and most satisfactory manner.
Wishing to be respectable, Joyce will not undertake the repairing or cleaning of any Watch or Clock, without being first permitted by the customer to make good the defective parts, which by having every necessary engine and tool for the purpose, he can do (however intricate the work) in a more reasonable and satisfactory manner than by half doing and often charging.
He has at present a variety of Clocks, which he will engage to the purchaser; also Gold, Silver, Enameled and Mettle Watches, of his own make, from two Guineas to fifty, with gold hands, keys, glasses, and every other article in his line of business of the best and cheapest kind.—

Such watches and clocks as he has occasion to import, are described according to his own ideas, and he trusts more for the advantage of his customers, than those imported by persons ignorant of the true principles and execution of such machine.

Robert Montgomery
, Clock and Watchmaker, at the Sign of the Gold Watch, No. 33, Wall street, opposite the Coffee-House Bridge, finds, from long experience, that people who keep Clocks in their houses often complain and with sufficient cause, of the annual expence attending them; for several housekeepers pay from one to four pounds yearly to keep them going. Therefore to remedy this grievance, said Montgomery intends to keep clocks in repair by the year, as is customary in Europe; for this purpose, every person leaving his address at Montgomery's shop, will have his clock wound up and regulated weekly—kept in constant good order—mended when necessary, with every other incidental charge, at so low a rate as Two Dollars per annum. No money required 'till the expiration of the year, and then not any if the clock does not go to liking.
Montgomery presumes that the advantages of his proposal are obvious; he therefore submits it to the indulgent public whom he shall endeavor to please, and whose favours he has so often experienced.—

Fire Places
.—Observations on the effect of Close and of Open Fire Places.
It is said, that the inhabitants of cold climates are more liable to inflammatory and consumptive disorders than those of warm climates....and it is a question, whether close or open fire places are the wholesomest? Prejudice among the Americans is great against those that are close, such as stoves. Whether facts are prevalent in support of this bias, may be questions. Perhaps the Germans of Pennsylvania, who universally use stoves, are less liable to consumptions than people who are accustomed to the open chimney fires....The German may be as safe in his extremes, as the Indian who heats himself in his hovel by means of hot stoves till he drips with sweat, and then plunges into a river of cold water....a writer in a British periodical paper...is of the opinion, that the pulmonary consumption of Britain is chiefly caused by the unequal distribution of heat, by means of open coal fires.—

New Invented Saw Mill
, a patent having been obtained for a saw mill on a new construction, it is now offered for public inspection, and any person wishing to use the same may be supplied with a right on moderate terms.
The advantage of this mill over one constructed with a crank, arises from its working by means of a lever of an optional length, so applied as to create and up and down or circular motion, by this means it has the advantage of ten feet to two, of purchase; and the lever being on a balance, has thus a tendecy to throw off the friction from the wheels of the machinery; The lever runs but on third of the circumference with the strain of the saw when cutting, the other two thirds runs entirely clear, by which you regain the motion the stroke of the saw in some measure retards.
This is allowed to be the only construction which, after getting a certain motion also gains power, owing to its leaving the works so clear of friction.
The crank at one foot from the centre has to lift the saw and frame of perhaps 400 lb wt. before the works can be put in motion; when the lever at three feet has not to raise 5 lb.
Ii is supposed that one half of the head of water applied to crank mills will do the same execution if applied to one of their construction.
This mill will be found to be of great use in a flat country where there is no fall of water as it can be easily worked to great advantage by horses or oxen. It can also be sucessfully applied to the sawing of marble, pumping of water for breweries and several other purposes.
Any person wishing to see the nature and utility of the above invention, is referred to the saw mill at Corlears hook, or to James Hallet Jun. No 9 Beekman Street.—

Fire Control in Houses
.—Fire. Mr. Taylor finding that there are many persons who doubt the possibility of securing houses, &c. from the ravages or accidental fires, and others who admit, yet imagine that a chemical preparation of some kind is necessary, think it proper to set the public (for whose benefit his inventions are intended) right, of informing them briefly,
1. That his method for preventing whole houses or a single room from being destroyed by fire, for which he obtained a patent, are simple, certain and permanent, and do not depend upon any chemical preparation whatever.
2. That he stops the spread of accidental fire, by rendering those parts of a house the most exposed to, and the least qualified for resisting the force of, fire, secure with solid materials, as any pavements.
3. Air being the active principle of fire, he hinders its admission and escape by closing the doors and windows and the chimney (if there be one in the room where the fire begins) by a valve, in consequence of which, any further progress of the fire is greatly retarded, if not wholly stopped, by the suffocating power of its own smoke.
This chimney valve is so contrived, that on the approach of any extraordinary degree of flame, it closes, by which means, if the chimney only happens to take fire, it will extinquish itself instantly, without giving trouble or alarm to anyone.
4. That it provides for the immediate Retention of the accidental fires; a reservoir under the floor of the house, to be filled with rain water, in which to augment its extenguishing power, he dissolves a quantity of pot ash. This water is to be conducted down the stair way, by a pipe, from whence it may on emergency be conveyed without loss of time to any part of the house where the fire may happen to begin.
5. These reservoirs will be found useful in preserving houses from accidental fires that may happen within but also a certain defence against the approach of any neighboring conflagration. They will also be found an effectual security to high and extensive ranges of warehouses, built wholly of timber, which on account of their situation on wharfs, &c. cannot always, in case of fire, be surrounded by men and engines, collected to extinquish the flames. Note. Those who secure their own workmen; his price for superintending the securing of a single room, in the city, is five dollars.
He also undertakes the remedying any imperfections in the ventilation of houses or chimnies, which occassions their smoaking. No. 13 Fair Street, New York.—

Wages
.—To the Public. A considerable Number of the principal Journeymen Carpenters in this City, think it incumbent on them to lay before the impartial Public, the following Impositions which the Masters have long practiced.
The Master Carpenters have long made it a pratice to employ Journeymen, (so very ignorant of their business, that even some of them have been at a loss to know the right end of their tools,) upon very low wages, while they charge the employer 12s. per day, the wages only paid to good workmen, and from which they have 1s. 6d. per day; for what reason? Because their ignorant Journeymen are taught by us, what the Masters ought to instruct them in.
About 12 of these Master Carpenters having agreed to reduce our Wages to 9s. per day, but still charging the employer 10s. 6d. and positively insist on having the above allowance made them, even should the wages be reduced to 6s. per day, we now submit our case to every candid Reader, who undoubtedly will justify our conduct in putting a stop to such iniquitous practices; therefore, in order to do justice to ourselves and the Public in general, we a select number of workmen, who know our Business, and are determined not to be imposed upon, will engage to finish any piece of work that Gentlemen may be pleased to employ us upon,...sending orders to Mr. Aaron Aarson's....The Journeymen Carpenters.
N.B. The Terms of Hire shall be made perfectly satisfactory, at the low charge of Nine Shillings per Day, as we should sooner receive our money from the Employer than from any of those Masters, whose ungenerous conduct justly merits our contempt.—

President's Barge
.—Thursday last, between 2 and 3 o'clock P. M. the Most Illustrious President of the U. S. arrived in this city. At Elizabethtown, he was received by a deputation of three Senators and five Representatives of the United States—..and three Officers of the State and Corporation—with whom he embarked on board the Barge, built for the purpose of wafting him across the Bay. Thirteen Pilots in white uniforms rowed this Barge, Thomas Randall, Esq., acting as Cockswain. It is impossible to do justice in an attempt to describe the scene exhibited on his Excellency's approach to the city. Innumerable multitudes thronged the shores, the wharves, and the shipping, waiting with pleasing anticipation his arrival. His Catholick Majesty's Sloop of War, the Galviston, the Ship North Carolina (Mr. Dohrman's) and other vessels were dressed, manned and highly decorated. His Excellency's Barge was accompanied by several other Barges, in one of which were the Hon. the Board of the Treasury, and the Minister of Foreign Affairs, and the Secretary of War, besides a long train of vessels and boats from New-Jersey and New-York. As he passed the Galviston, she fired a salute of 13 guns. The ship, North Carolina, and the Battery, also welcomed his approach with the same number. The whole water scene was highly animated—moving in regular order—the grand Gala formed an object the most interesting imaginable. On his Excellency's arrival at the stairs, prepared and ornamented, at Murray's Wharf, for his landing, he was saluted by Col. Bauman's artillery, and received and congratulated by his Excellency the Governour, and the Officers of the State and Corporation—from whence the procession moved in the following order....The procession moved through Queen Street to the House prepared for the reception of the President—from whence he was conducted, without form, to the Governour's where his Excellency dined.
This great occasion arrested the publick attention beyond all powers of description—the hand of industry was suspended—and the various pleasures of the Capital were concentrated to a single enjoyment. All ranks and professions expressed their feelings in loud acclamations, and with rapture hailed the arrival of the Father of His Country.—

Marine Ventilators
invented by Mr. Benjamin Wynkoop, for ventilating ships, may justly be numbered with the most important nautical improvements. The simplicity, durability, and Compact structure of the machines, are peculiarly adapted to the purpose for which they were designed; and their constant vibration, produced by the motion of the ship alone, will keep the air in free circulation throughout the remotest parts of the ship. Those who are immediately acquainted with the injurious effects of foul air on the health of the persons on board ships, and on perishable Cargoes, as well as the frames of ships, will justly appreciate their worth. It excites astanishment that a subject of such magnitude should have been so long neglected, when we take into view, the still more important consideration of the fatal effects produced by the introduction of pestilential diseases into our ports. Those diseases in many instances are doubtless generated on board of ships (not ventilated) by the putrid exhalations from perishible materials on board, which are ultimately discharged on our shores, and like Pandora's box spread disease and desolation thro our flourishing Cities.
These remarks are a result of the beneficial effect experienced from two such ventilators on board the brig Benjamin Franklin, on her late passage from Bourdeaux. Her Cargo was altogether wines, near 800 HHDS. of which were Claret wines; it is liable to fermentation, and consequently very considerable loss; the Cargo was landed in the most perfect order perhaps ever witnessed on a similar Cargo, after filling up the Casks the loss did not exceed one and a half per cent.
By the operation of the ventilators the hold was kept perfectly cool, the bilge water free from smell, and the paint work not in the least discolored. On his voyage previous to the construction of the ventilators on board, the reverse of all this was the case, and only 90 HHDS. of wine on board.
Two ventilators which are amply sufficient for any ship, will not occupy the space of four barrels of flour.—

Samuel Kempton
, Tin Plate Worker, copper and Iron Smith, No. 197 Water-Street, near the Coffee-House, where he executes with neatness and dispatch, the different articles in the above Branches; and will gratefully acknowledge all favours of his Friends and the Public in general.
He has made upon an improved plan, and has ready for sale, a few of those truly useful Machines, called Bidets, so much used in England and France, and so generally in all warm climates; their utility is not only in the personal cleanliness and comfort attending the use of them, but in the salutary invigorating and bracing effect, which the applicatioin of a partial cold Bath affords to both sexes. Particularly where the constitution is relaxed by nature or accident. The celebrated doctor Graham in his admired Lectures upon the preservation of Health and Vigour and on the renovating of constitutions injured by luxurious excesses, particularly recommends the daily use of Bidets filled with the coldest water, and has exhibited various proofs of their efficacy in removing imbecility and barreness, which the use of all the restorative medicines has failed to produce.
He also makes, on the most improved construction, a small convenient apparatus for the purpose of a Shower Bath, which from its size can be used in a dressing room or bedchamber without any detriment to the room and furniture; the use of the shower Bather is recommended by the most eminent physicians, particularly where violent shock is required to quicken the circulation of the blood, and to brace the constitution weakened and relaxed by climate or excess.
Many people who are sensible of the salutary effects of the Cold Bath, are prevented from the use of them, from situation and the inconvenient distance of a proper place for the purpose; this apparatus furnishes that convenience immediately and by the use of six or eight gallons of cold water the body is as much refreshed, and the diseases, for which bathing is a remedy are as effectually relieved by means of the simple machine, and by the use of an extensive Cold Bath.
He has also for sale, Willard's much esteemed patent clock Jacks, they are valuable above the other roast meat jacks, being moveable, and may be used in any room. They require less fire, and will roast meat in a shorter time than any other now in use. use.
He has on Hand, a very large and extensive assortment of all kinds of Tin, Copper, Brass and Japanned wares and as he manufactures the most of the articles in the different branches aforesaid, he is determined that none shall undersell him, either for cash or short credit.

New York Air Furnace
, Peter T. Curtenius and Co. have repaired the New-York Air Furnace, and have procured the best workmen together with the necessary apparatus to carry on the Manufactory of Cast Iron in the completest and best manner. Castings made in an Air Furnace, are allowed by all who are acquainted with the nature of Founderies, to be better than what is made in a Blast Furnace; because, in an Air Furnace, the ware is made out of the softest and best Pig Metal, and, by its being melted a second time, the scoria, or dross, is expelled and nothing but the pure Metal remains. In a Blast Furnace, the castings are made out of the first smelting of the crude Ore, and are more or less mixt with dross, which subjects the ware to be rough and spongy, and often full of cold shuts; the difference, in short, is nearly the same as there is between refined and Bloomery Iron. The ware they have made is allowed, by good judges, to be as light, as smooth, and as good as any imported from Europe. This consideration alone, of the ware being as good as the foreign, is a sufficient inducement, for an American, to give the preference to the manufactures of his own country; but a more powerful argument for the purchaser to give it a preference is, that it can be afforded cheaper than the imported ware, chiefly owning to a duty of six pounds per ton being laid on foreign castings. The ware manufactured at this Furnace, consists of the following articles, viz.
Pots and kettles of various sizes from one to fifteen gallons, tea kettles, pye pans, skillets, griddles, potash kettles and coolers, whaling kettles, boilers for tallow chandlers and sugar works, stoves for sugar bakers, mill cases, cast bars for sugar works and distilleries, rollers and shears for slitting mills, chimney backs, hearth and jamb plates, cast agreeable to any pattern that may be sent; close stoves for work shops, Franklin stoves neatly decorated with carved work, Bath stoves grates elegantly ornamented with carvings, ship's cabouses of the new construction, with bake ovens in them, in which the same fire that roasts and boils the meat bakes the bread; mill rounds and gudgeons, saw mill Cranks, calcining plates for making pearlashes, cast iron screws for fulling and paper mills, fullers plates cast to any size that may be wanted, sash weights, forge hammers and anvils, plow plates, half hundreds, quarters, fourteen and elevn pound weights; cart waggon, coach, phaeton, chair and sulkey boxes, &c. &c. &c.
N.B. Persons who want any backs, or other ware, cast agreeable to particular patterns, will please to send their patterns and orders to the Furnace, near Mr. Atlee's Brewery or leave them at the house of Peter T. Curtenius No. 48, Great Dock street near the Exchange.—

Counterfeit Coins
.—A number of artful villains, for some time past, have practised the business of coining base metals in imitation of English and French guineas, and Spanish dollars and quarter guineas.
Isaac Atwood and John Hambrow, from Birmingham in England, and several others are committed further offence, and it is hoped will soon be brought to trial, Some of the tools and instruments employed in counterfeiting have been found.
The counterfeit French guineas, which are the worst executed, may be known by the sound being flat. The hair of the head resembles balls or lumps, instead of natural curls, and is too great in breadth. These pieces weigh a little more than three penny weight, and are made of copper gilded. The counterfeit dollars are dated 1782, and to be distinquished by the out line of the back of the head, which is not sufficiently round; the nostril un-natural, and not enough raised on the outside; the III after carolus too small and crouded, and the face too long. Some are blanced copper, others of copper silvered, or, as the artists express it, boiled.
The counterfeit English guineas are dated 1784, the eye is too downcast, and the nose and forehead too erect; the eyebrow not raised; the nose too broad, the colour resembling brass, and the fleurs de lis in the crown, which they ought not. They seem to be a composition of gold, silver and copper, and want but a few grains of the English standard weight.—

Scarcity of Paper
.—As many of the customers for this Paper, are not acquainted with the real cause of their not being weekly supplied with the news for some time past, the Printer now informs them, that scarcity of printing paper, and frequent disappointments in his endeavors to obtain it, are the reasons. He early last Fall, sent cash to a friend in Philadelphia, where he was encouraged to hope for a constant supply; but was disappointed though he went there himself, owing to the great demand for paper by the printers in that city, who generally engross it at the paper mills. He had frequently before sent to Boston and Connecticut for paper, where he had received a few scatry supplies; and was encouraged last fall to expect a stock for winter from Connecticut, having sent value before-hand to purchase it: none, however was forwarded by land while the roads were passable, but delayed till January, when a number of reams were shipped, in order to be landed in Fairfield, which unhappily were taken by the enemy.
With much pains and cost, he has obtained a pretty considerable stock of paper; and at the request of many of his customers, he intends to publish his News-paper in a folio size. The price for the ensuing quarter, will be Six Dollars, as it cannot be afforded for less, while the necessaries of life continue so high; when they fall, the price of the Paper will be lowered accordingly. The money to be paid at entrance. If any or all of the subscribers for the Packet, would pay Four Shillings each, in country products, the old way it will be very agreeable. Those who choose to discontinue taking this paper, will be pleased to inform the Printer, by post, or otherwise. The first opportunity.—

Paper Manufacture
.—Rags, the Printers, actuated by a desire to promote the manufacture of paper in America but particularly in this state, take in Linen Rags, either in large or small quantities, for the Paper Mills....Pennsylvania employ 18 or 20 Paper Mills, Jersey 2 or 3, and we have only one in our State; and though but one, it can scarcely be supported with a sufficient quantity of rags. The reason is obvious, viz. inattention in our grave old matrons, and carelessness in those of fewer years. It is therefore sincerely wished, that our citizens, but particularly the Ladies and Taylors, would be careful in reserving all their useless linen fragments for the above salutary purpose. And as a further inducement they will be pleased to recollect that they will, by so doing be instrumental in supporting a species of manufacture which can, with some degree of attention be easily brought to perfection in this country.—

Fashions
. Before the Croisades cost the Christian world so many millions of subjects, there was a sort of uniform dress in Europe.—Those who returned from the ineffectual wars of Palestine, were the first to bring with them the fashions of the East, and the most remarkable of these was the long cloak, which in the 12th century reached only to the knee; but before the 15th century, the nobility assumed a long train, imagining that the abasement of the servant gave a greater appearance of dignity to the master. But knights and princes only were allowed to wear those cloaks, and their consorts the robe, sometimes with and without gold.
For the space of above three centuries, people had the appearance of quiet members of society; no such thing as a sword by way of dress; nobility was noted by a long purse hanging at the girdle, a custom maintained by the Highlanders at this day; whereas the piece of iron which our modern gentleman now sticks at his side, carries with it an air of suspicion and turbulency.
The covering for the head was a hood, with a roll or pad at top, and a tail hanging behind. This was worn by the Irish, even early in the present century, the peasantry of that nation being the last who retained it in Europe.
In Henry the 7th's time, and even in Henry the 8th's, emblazoned or party-coloured cloaths were worn, like our present heralds and pursuivants, quartered in patches of family arms, as were also the bipartite garments, half of one colour, and half of another. But things will change, and in the meridian of the latter Princes reign, Francis the first introduced the fashion of short clothes, like the pantaloon dress, being a doublet short skirted, and drawers and stockings all of a piece; this being close, and yielding to the body, caused many indecent appearances. Some serious people introduced the Swiss breeches, a sort of trunk hose, which came down only to the middle of the thighs, and over it a half petticoat. To this succeeded the exact dress of our running footmen.
As the ladies may be curious to know how their sex was dressed, they will be gratified in being told, that in 1409 the head dress was a high sugar-loaf bonnet, with a veil fastened to the top of it, and hanging down more or less, according to the persons rank. The veil of a citizens wife came only to the shoulders, that of a knight's lady swept the ground.—In Henry the VIIIth's time, the ladies wore little hats, with a feather; from that time to the year 1600, succeeded small caps, with aigrettes or pompoons.
In 1650, the men took it into their heads that a big belly had something majestic in it, on which the women (like the women of the present day) immediately fancied that prominent posteriors were equally ornamental; then appeared nothing but false big bellies, and false big bottoms; and ridiculous as this custom was, it lasted near four years. What is very odd, no sooner had it began, than the sex seemed to give themselves no farther concern about their faces; for they hid them under a mask, never failing to put it on when they went abroad; this continued down to the end of the last century. The masks were superceded by patches, used to such extravagance, as to make the face scarcely discernible. To this succeeded
rouge
, copied from the Roman Generals, who painted on public triumphs. This custom is still retained, with all the other pretty extravagancies introduced in the dresses of our modern daughters of Eve, who seem totally to forget the naked simplicity of their grand-dames.—

Fashions
.—To the Ladies. A writer in a morning print observes, that neither religion nor morality are affected by the materials or ornaments of dress, a position which no man in his senses will contradict; but this writer will not maintain, that religion and morality are not affected by the fashion of dress. Every voluntary action must have an end in view.
When ladies bare their bosoms, there is an end in view. When ladies tuck up their petticoats and display their legs, there is an end in view. When ladies put on false rumps, there is an end in view.
And though this end may not immediately strike the eye corporeal, yet, it is evident in the minds eye of every man possessing sensibility.
Now my fair country women, will you not allow that when fashion tend to expose this end to the mind's eye, it warms the imagination?—And—
When the imagination is warmed, what becomes of morality?—And When morality flies, can religion make a stand? Then for the sake of morality and religion, up with your tuckers—down with your petticoats, and off with your rumps SQUIB.—

On Female Dress
. Every woman of taste who piques herself on being distinquished for her dress, is ready to pay the same attention to fashion as the Bastard in King Lear to nature, and adopting his spirited language to exclaim, `Thou, Fashion, art my goddess; to thy laws, my services are bound'.
Fashion is substituted here with particular propriety, as the fine ladies of the age, in opposition to the laws of nature, bind their services to her, and obey her capricious commands, however, ridiculous they may, secretly, think they are, with the most perfect submission, and would be shocked to death to appear in the politest circle, dressed like no other woman in the place, though in a manner not only suitable to her person, age, and situation in life but even elegant and becoming. Such is the sway of Fashion, such is her dispotic power.—

Face Wash
.—A most Excellent Wash for the Ladies. Take of fair clear water quantum sufficit, put it into a clean earthen or china bason; then take a clean linen cloth, dip it in the water, and apply it to the face night and morning or oftener, as occasion may require.
This lotion cannot be too strongly recommended to the fair-sex, on account of its purity and simplicity. It is free from all the inconveniences and nastiness of all other preparations of art whatsoever. It does not corrode the skin, as many others do; it does not destroy the eyes, nor rot the teeth, as many others do; and it does not communicate itself by collosion, nor betray the transfactions of a Tete a Tete, as most others do.—

American Manufacture
. The President of the United States, on the day of his inauguration, appeared dressed in a complete suit of homespun cloaths; but the cloth was of so fine a Fabric, and so Handsomely finished, that it was universally mistaken for a foreign manufactured superfine cloth. This fact, the Editor hopes, will apologize for his not having mentioned, in his last paper, a circumstance, which must be considered as not only flattering to our manufacturers in particular but interesting to our Countrymen in general.
His Excellency the Vice President, appears also in a suit of American Manufacture and several members of both Houses are distinguished by the same token of attention to the manufacturing interest of their country.—

Umbrellas
.—Hint to the Importers. A correspondent, who observed the citizens on Sunday last leaving the several churches after service, was extremely sorry to find the ladies so incommoded by the rain. This inconvenience was occasioned by the small size of most of the Umbrellas that are at present in use. In several instances he observed, that a considerable part of the hats and bonnets of the ladies were without any shelter against the rain, as the umbrellas from their smallness, were insufficient to cover them. It is therefore hoped that the next importation of Umbrellas will be of a larger size....—

The Side Curl

The Forte-Piano is become so exceedingly fashionable in Europe that few polite families are without it. This much esteemed instrument forms an agreeable accompaniment for the female voice, takes up but little room, may be moved with ease, and consequently kept in tune with little attention—so that it is on that account supperior to the harpsi-chord. The improvements which Messrs. Dodds and Clause have made in the Forte-Piano, has rendered it much more acceptable than those imported. The introduction of their new invented hammers and dampers, is acknowledged to be a great improvement, as also the means they have taken to prepare their wood to stand the effect of our Climatte, which imported instruments never do, but are sure to suffer not only from the agitation of the vessel, but the saline qualities of the seas. One great advantage to the purchaser is, that Messrs. Dodds and Claus make it an invariable rule to repair any instrument that may prove defective in the workmanship, if applied to within 2 years after delivery. At this manufactory every kind of musical instruments are finished according to the present taste, and with the latest improvements, as good and cheap as in the City of London. Instruments sold on commission, taken in exchange, let out, repaired and tuned, in the best manner and on the most reasonable terms. N.B. A good allowance is made to dealers in these articles.—

Organ builder, Grand and Small Piano Forte Materials (from London) most Respectfully informs the amateurs of music and the public in general, that the Organ, he is about building for the Lutheran Church in William and corner of Frankfort street, is nearly finished and will be opened the beginning of next month, when it will be exhibited to view for a few days; by the indulgence of the trustees of the said Church, for the benefit of the builder, and to shew the public what can be done in this part of the world, as nothing belonging to it has been imported from any foreign country.
The builder flatters himself that the fullness and melodiousness of its tone, together with the neatness and durability of the work, and particular new movement, which renders the touch so easy as to be playable by a child, cannot be excelled. The plain elegance of the outside of the case, will appear corresponding with the inward work. The framer will, for a few days, display the powers of this work with an intent, by this view, to lead Amateurs of this country to a judgment, now, taking this organ for a pattern, which has but 800 pipes on the same scale, harmony might be increased by 600 pipes and upwards, and some of which 37 feet in length. The builder does not think himself only satisfied in the business, but would wish to meet with the approbation of connoisseurs. Notice will be given in a few days of the time appointed for the opening of the Organ with the name of an eminent performer.—

As motives of delicacy may induce parents to commit the tuition of young Ladies in this branch of education, to one of their own sex and the female voice from its being in unison, is better adapted to teach them singing, than that of the other sex, which is an octave below, she flatters herself that she shall be indulged with their approbation and the protection of a respectable public.

French Yankee Doodle
.—From the Independent Chronicle. Caire! or the New Yankee Doodle! Some persons object to the playing this republican tune at the New Theatre, because it is imported: Pray, let it ask are not the players, and pieces to be performed, imported also? Are not in fact the musicians imported? and shall we object to this tune, merely because it is of foreign growth? Certain No. Scarcely a tune that is played is manufactured in America; we must therefore have some imported tunes, and no one will so well please a republican ear as the French Yankee Doodle, alias CAIRE.—

The Progress of Balloons
.
Assist me, ye muses, (whose harps are in tune)
To tell of the flight of the gallant balloon!
As high as my subject permit me to soar,
To heights unattempted, unthought of before.
Ye grave learned Doctors whose trade is to sigh,
Who labour to chalk out a road to the sky,
Improve on your plans,—or I'll venture to say,
A chymist, of Paris, will show us the way.
The earth, on its surface, has all been survey'd.
The sea has been travell'd,—and deep in the shade,
The kingdom of Pluto has heard us at work
When we dig for his metals, wherever they lurk.
But who would have thought that invention could rise,
To find out a method to soar to the skies,
And pierce the bright regions, which assign'd
To spirits unbodied, and flights of the mind.
Let the Gods of Olympus their revels prepare—
By the aid of some pounds of inflammable air
We'll visit them soon—and forsake this dull ball,
With coat, shoes and stockings, fat carcase and all.
How France is distinguish'd in Louis's reign!
What cannot her genius and courage attain?
Throughout the wide world have her
arms
found the way,
And
art
to the stars is extending her sway.
At sea let the British their neighbours defy—
The French shall have frigates to traverse the sky—
In this navigation more fortunate prove,
And cruise at their ease in the climates above.
If the English should venture to sea with their fleet,
A host of balloons in a trice they shall meet,
The French from the zenith their wings shall display,
And souse on these sea dogs and bear them away.
Ye sages who travel on mighty designs,
To measure meridians and parallel lines—
The task being tedious—take heed if you please—
Construt a balloon—and you'll do it with ease.
And ye who the heavens, broad concave survey,
And aided by glasses, its secrets betray,
Who gaze, the night through, at the wonderful scene,
Yet still are complaining of vapours between.
Ah, seize the conveyance, and fearlessly rise
To peep at the
lanthorns
that light up the skies
And floating above, on our ocean of air,
Informs us, by letter, what people are
there
.
In Saturn, advise us if snow ever melts,—
And what are the uses of Jupiter's belts;
And (Mars being willing) pray send us word, greeting,
If his people are fonder of fighting than eating.
That Venus has horns we've no reason to doubt,
(I forget what they all him who first found it out,
And you'll find, I'm afraid, if you venture to near)
That the spirits of cuckolds inhabit her sphere.
Our folks of good morals it woefully grieves,
That Mercury's people are villains aand thieves,
You'll see how it is,—but I'll venture to show,
For a dozen among them, twelve dozens below.
From long observation one proof may be had
That the men in the moon are incurably mad;
However, compare us, and if they exceed
They must be surprizingly crazy indeed.
But now to have done with our planets and moons
Come, grant me a patent for making balloons—
For I find that the time is approaching—the day—)
When horses shall fail, and the horsemen decay.
Post riders, at present (call'd centaurs of old
Who brave all the seasons, hot weather and cold,
In future shall leave their dull poneys behind,
And travel, like ghosts, on the wings of the wind.
The stageman, whose gallopers scarce have the power,
Through the dirt to convey you ten miles in an hour,
When advanc'd to balloons shall so furiously drive,
You'll hardly know whether you're dead or alive.
The man who at Boston sets out with the sun'
If the wind should be fair, may be with us at one,
At Gunpowder Ferry drink whisky at three,
And at six be at Edenton ready for tea.
(The machine shall be order'd, we hardly need say,
To travel in darkness as well as by day)
At Charleston by ten he for sleep shall prepare,
And by twelve the next day be the Devil knows where.
When the ladies grow sick of the city in June
What a jaunt they shall have in the flying balloon!
Whole mornings shall see them at toilets preparing,
And forty miles high be their afternoon's airing.
Yet more with its fitness for commerce I'm struck—
What loads of tobacco shall fly from Kentuck.
What packs of best beaver—bar-iron and pig,
What budgets of leather from Conoccocheague!
If Britain should ever disturb us again,
(As they threaten to do in the next George's reign)
No doubt they will play us a set of new tunes,
And pepper us well from their fighting balloons.
To market the farmers shall shortly repair
With their hogs and potatoes, wholesale, thro' the air,
Skim over the water as light as a feather,
Themselves and their turkies conversing together.
Such wonders as these from ballons shall arise—
And the giants of old that assaulted the skies,
With their Ossa on Pelion, shall freely confess
That all they attempted was nothing to this.
An Air Balloon
, thirty feet high, with a Gallery and a Boat, to be adorned in a beautiful manner, is at present constructing in the Academy of Polite Arts, which will be launched in the academy yard, as soon as four hundred subscribers at One Dollar each, can be procured, of which timely notice will be given.—
Independent Journal

Balloon
.—Description of a Balloon 24 Feet high and 55 in circumference, exhibited on the 28th of September last in Philadelphia, by Mr. Busselot.
This balloon was in the form of a globe, divided into 18 ribs, between which was placed blue strips, elegantly adorned with 13 silver stars; the whole supported by a red crown, fixed in the interior part of the balloon, with a dark ground, that had the most agreeable effect. At six o'clock, P.M. Mr. Busselot began to fill the balloon, which exhibited the most beautiful appearance to a respectable and numerous company. It rose with some difficulty, on account of the breeze having entirely failed; it ascended most majestically about 3000 feet, which distance from the ground it constantly kept until its fall on the Jersey shore, having in the course of 35 minutes vaulted about six miles in the air without any breeze.—

Aerostation
—This morning Mr. Blanchard made his 45th ascension from the prison yard to the aerial regions....At last, everything being ready, Mr. Blanchard respectfully took his leave of the President, who gave him a folded paper, which we suppose to be a recommendation to the inhabitants of whatever place he may light upon. After he had taken his leave, the president called him back and said something to him that we did not hear. Then the aeronaut, having bowed to the Spectators, ascended his boat, which was printed blue, and spangled with stars on the outside and, holding in his hand a flag with the colours of the United States, he threw out part of his ballast, and precisely at 5 minutes past 10 o'clock, the balloon rose slowly and perpendicularly to soft music, amidst the shouts and burst of applause of all the Spectators. The President took off his hat, and bowed to him as he ascended....It was indeed a spectacle as magnificent as it was new to us, to see this intrepid aeronaut majestically rise from the earth without betraying the least symptom of fear on his countenance, but smiling on the astonished spectators whose hearts were filled with an anxiety he did not seem to partake. As he rose, he gracefully moved his flag, as taking an affectionate farewell of his friends. `Bon Voyage, God bless you, all', was reechoed from every mouth, hats waved, hands lifted up, all testified the interests that every beholder took in the success of this bold undertaking. For some minutes the shouts of applause were suspended, and an awful silence best expressed at this moment the feelings of the spectators....Indeed we are at a loss to account for the little encouragement that Mr. Blanchard has received in this city....We are credibly informed that the amount of Subscriptions will fall short by 400 £ of reimbursing his expences. Our credit as a liberal Nation is at stake....About half past 6 o'clock we were happy to see Mr. Blanchard again in this city....he informed us his aerial voyage lasted 46 minutes, in which time he ran over a space of more than 15 miles, and then descended a little to the eastward of Woodbury in the State of New Jersey where he took a carriage and returned to Cooper's ferry and was at the President's, as we have already mentioned at half past 6 o'clock in the evening.—
New-York Daily Advertiser

Forty-sixth Ascension
.—The Celebrated aeronaut Blanchard, has opened a subscription to enable him to effect a forty sixth ascension. He is to have a fellow traveller, whose name has not yet trnspired. The car in which they are to be borne is to be octagonal, representing a fort and to be water proof.—
The Herald

Subscription for Flight of Balloon
.—G. Baker, Having given Mr. Blanchard the fullest assurances, that the liberality of the Citizens of New York was such, that it would be easy to raise 3,000 by subscription, as a reward for his sublime aeriel flight. This liberality is daily becoming exemplified by the increased subscriptions, but the fatigues of waiting on the citizens at this very warm season, is very great. G. B. particularly solicits, that those liberal ladies and gentlemen, who wish to be partakers in the great expence that will attend the preparations of this very interesting scene, are requested to subscribe on some of the subscription papers which are left at the coffee houses and other public places, as soon as possible, which will very much fecilitate the undertaking.
It is expected, that the Balloon will be suspended to be seen by subscribers, in about two weeks, and the ascention will be made with all convenient speed, of which at least two weeks notice will be given, before the day fixed on for the Flight. Considerable more than one Thousand Dollars is already subscribed, and Three Thousand will secure the object, so as to place Messrs Blanchard and Baker in the Delightful aerial Regions.—
The Argus

Balloon
. Messrs Blanchard & Baker have the pleasure to inform the subscribers, and other citizens of New-York, that the Balloon is arrived from Boston, and that it is at the house adjoining to where the ascension will take place; that the house will be erected to suspend the Balloon in with all speed, and the Amphitheatre will also be built as soon as possible; and that the tickets will be prepared and ready for delivery within a few days, when the subscribers will be waited on. It is hoped that no person will lose the present opportunity of purchasing a ticket to see the Balloon and all the apparatus for inflating it; as it must be expected that the present ascension will be the last in America, on account of the great expence attending this charming philosophical experiment.—
The Diary
, August 18, 1796.
Parachute
.—Philosophical Experiment of a Parachute. Mr. Blanchard has just now made, with no small expence, a new solid Air Balloon, which neither stones or snow balls can destroy, as they did the former, at the moment of departure. This tri-coloured Balloon, loaded with a parachute, and several quadrupeds, will ascend from the Ball Alley, this Day, the 4th of March between 3 and 4 o'clock, P. M.—provided there is not wind or rain. The tickets of admission will cost but 4 shillings, and will be sold on the spot, Broadway, No. 247, this morning. P. S.

Harpsichord, Piana-Forte, a first and second Flute and organ; these instruments may all be played together, forming one of the most beautiful, sublime and soft concerts that the ear can wish: At any stage of the tune that it may be playing, the Flutes, may be stopped, and the Piano Forte and Harpsichord left to perform alone; or the Harpsichord and Piano may be stopped as the Flutes, and they may be left to perform alone; so that the instruments may be separated and united in any stage of the music, and it may be made to performed fast or slow, as required.
This Clock was designed and executed by Mr. Henry Moelsinger, Clock and Watchmaker, who arrived at Philadelphia in autumn last (from Manheim, in Germany) where he now follows his business, but expects shortly to reside in this city.
Description of the Case.
The case is made of the best Mahogany, by a most excellent workman. The architecture is of an entire new construction, and is of an irregular form very pleasing to the eye, having no analogy to the customary method of making clock cases; and will be found to form an elegant pattern. The cabinet-makers, Mess. Gifford and Scotland, will be intitled to much merit for this design and execution, with the Paintings and decoration—On the Pedestal appear two beautiful youths, represented playing upon flutes, very animated; above these appear a very handsome Lady, seated under a rich canopy, (beautifully decorated with drapery) playing the Piano-Forte; above, on the top of the canopy a small globe appears, surrounded by a beautiful sky with clouds interspersed. An Eagle hovering, suspending in its beak, a shield with the fifteen united stripes, in one talon an olive branch, in the other a bundle of arrows; above these is seen glittering rays with fifteen stars interspersed, and over this the eye of Providence. On the top of the Case, is seen, in burnished gold, in the centre, Fame, with his trumpet, in a handsome attitude; on his right, Justice, and on his left Liberty—very handsomely finished. The painting was executed by Mr. Joseph Weaver, and the gilding and carving by Mr. Harding, both of this city.
This Clock and Case cost upward of Eight Hundred Dollars.
II. A Glass Republican Ship.—This ship is ten inches in length, mounts fourteen guns, and with all the rigging is made entirely of glass, (the colors and figurehead excepted) all the ropes and rigging being very nicely proportioned.
III. A very fine Camera, for viewing prints; with fifty colored views of the most elegant buildings of ancient Rome, with some of it antiquities. Six very handsome paintings of the first kind, being views in France.
IV. Fifty eight cases with glass in front, containing near 600 Birds from Europe, Asia, Africa, and America; Here the book of nature is unfolded, the Gold and Silver Pheasants of China—and the following families amongst which are 6 Parrots of different species, 10 Parroquets, 9 Woodpeckers, 7 Cuckoos, 10 Pigeons, 5 Toucans or bill birds, 16 Humming birds, about 20 Hawks, birds of bray, 14 Starlings and black-birds, 11 Jays, 12 Robins, 12 Butcher birds of prey, 23 Nightingales, 21 Sparrows and Yellow-hammers 28 Widdow-birds, Canary birds, Sparrows, and Greenfinches, 16 Wood peckers, 19 Tangara, 27 Bullfinches, Goldfinches and Tomtits, 23 Linnets and Red throats, 9 Swallows, 11 Larks, 21 Sparrows, Greenfinches, Chaffinches and Linnets, 7 Owls, 12 black birds and Pratlers.—With a great number that are not classed in families.
And between 2 and 3000 insects, such as butterflies, stinging bees, Biting flies and Beetles—One box 26 by 18 inches, contains one thousand and forty-two different species of Beetles arranged in families.
This collection of birds and insects, for their state of preservation, classification, arrangement, and beautiful order, is said not to be excelled, at this time, in any part of the world. Gardiner Baker.

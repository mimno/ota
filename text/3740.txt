INTRODUCTION.
IT is generally allowed, that the most easy method of attaining any living language is to associate and converse with those who speak it. Nevertheless, when a foreigner has by this means so far acquired the English tongue, that he shall be able to speak it, and understand it when spoken, tolerably well, he will yet find himself greatly at a loss, when he attempts to read: because the manner of expressing sounds by letters in his own language is so very different from ours, that many English words, which he is well acquainted with by ear, will not appear to him to be the same when he sees them in writing.—For not only various sounds are expressed in the English language by the same vowels; but also, in many particular words, a kind of arbitrary pronunciation is used, which cannot easily be reduced to rule, and is therefore most commonly taught merely by ear, or imitation.
This latter difficulty, I am afraid, cannot be removed; but, I think, it may be relieved in some degree, by separating all such words from those which are capable of being taught by rule. This I have attempted, and have accordingly collected all, or the greatest part of such kind of words, under their proper heads, as exceptions to the several rules given in the following pages, together with a short explanation of their sound.—By this means a learner may have his task before him, and may easily refer to any particular word, as he shall have occasion; which will greatly relieve his memory.
I have not taken notice of all the derivatives and compounds which properly belong to the several exceptions, but for the most part of primitive words only, for the sake of brevity; which I hope will be thought sufficient, the others being naturally comprehended therein. Many words indeed are varied according to the different position of the accent, which not only shortens the articulation of the succeeding syllables, but in some words causes them to be so indistinctly pronounced, that it is sometimes difficult to determine what vowels are sounded therein: yet if the learner is but careful to give the accented syllable its proper pronunciation according to the following rules, he will naturally fall into the customary utterance of the other syllables, which, as they are pronounced quick, need not be studied so particularly.
The rules treat only of the general power of the vowels and diphthongs, because in these consist the most material differences between the English pronunciation and that of foreigners; but I have added thereto, by way of appendix, a short treatise (drawn up and communicated by a friend) for the explanation of such particularities also of the other letters as are peculiar to the English tongue.
All which together (I flatter myself) will be sufficient to enable a foreigner to read and pronounce any English words with ease and certainty, when the syllables of the same are properly divided according to the learned Dr. Lowth's excellent rule for spelling, given in the 7th page of his English grammar, viz.
The best and
only sure rule
for dividing the syllables in spelling, is to divide them as they are naturally divided in a right pronunciation; without regard to the derivation of words, or the possible combination of consonants at the beginning of a syllable.
Mr. John Gignoux likewise particularly recommends and explains this method, in the preface to his spelling-book, intituled,
The Child's best Instructor in Spelling and Reading.
A title which it seems well to deserve, on account of the division of the several syllables according to the manner above-mentioned, by which it is rendered (in my opinion at least) the most useful book of the sort that has hitherto been published.
I must however observe, that the author, in his
Table of Words written very different from their Pronunciation,
at page 82, has too much followed the common London pronunciation; which, tho' perhaps in general the best, yet has some very exceptionable particularities. Among which are,
Potticary
for Apothecary,
Athist
for Atheist,
Awkurd
for Aukward,
Riccolas
for Auricolas,
Belcony
for Balcony,
Carrin
for Carrion,
Sirket
for Circuit,
Crowner
for Coroner,
Gorjus
for Gorgeous,
Hankerchur
for
Handkerchief, I'urn
for Iron,
Ilan
for Island,
Spanel
for Spaniel,
Stummuch
for Stomach,
Sound
for Swoon,
Thusty
for Thirsty,
Vawt
for Vault,
Venzun
for Venison,
Verdit
for Verdict, &c.
Also in page 57 he signifies that the terminations
-tial, -cial, -cian, -tious, -cious, -tient,
and
cient,
make each of them
but one sound or syllable.
But however common such pronunciation may be, it ought not by any means to be taught, or laid down as a rule; because the English language loses much of its elegance, when it is expressed in so careless a manner, that any of the above-mentioned terminations shall seem but one syllable.
The
i
in all these terminations has the sound of the English
e;
and though it is pronounced quick, yet it ought to be distinctly expressed, as in
Parti-al, Soci-al, Greci-an, Capti-ous, Graci-ous, Quoti-ent, Anci-ent,
&c. There fore I hope that the author, in his next edition of that useful book, will make some alteration in his explanation of these particulars.
Others, besides Mr. Gignoux, have been misled by the indistinct manner in which some particular syllables are sometimes uttered even by good speakers. Mr. James Buchanan in particular has given himself much unnecessary trouble, and has carried his refinements a great deal too far concerning syllables of this kind, which, in quick pronunciation, have seemed to him to partake of an articulation different from the real spelling. This has, unfortunately, not only added great difficulty to his
An Essay towards establishing a Standard for an elegant and uniform Pronunciation of the English Language, as practised by the most learned and polite Speakers.
performance, but rendered it almost incapable of answering the good purposes intended by it. For he has frequently substituted an imaginary articulation of one vowel for the inarticulation, or rather the short and indistinct sound, of another; not considering that the expressing of an accented syllable in many particular words does almost unavoidably cause the succeeding syllable or syllables to be so indistinctly pronounced, that it is sometimes difficult to determine what vowels are sounded therein, as I have before observed.
But when words are so pronounced, that instead of the short or indistinct sound of one vowel, a manifest articulation of another different vowel may be distinguished; it then becomes a fault in speech, which (howsoever common it may be) ought by no means to be imitated, much less taught; because the generality of people are naturally too liable of themselves to acquire it, without being led thereto by written instructions.
The following examples taken from Mr. Buchanan's book will illustrate what has been said; viz. He has substituted -ĭl for the terminations -al, -ial, and -el, as
Năivĭl, Neutrĭl, Kŏmĭk
l, Joodeĕshĭl, Spĕshĭl, Quărĭl,
&c. for Naval, Neutral, Comical, Judicial, Special, Quarrel, &c.
Mr. Peyton's
"New Vocabulary or Grammar of the true pronunciation of the English"
is not less liable to censure, for the same words are there rendered Nai-vel, Ni
u
trel, djŏu-dĭ-chiel, Spe-chiel, Couâr-ril, &c.
-in
for -an, as
Heumin, Orgĭn,
&c. for Human, Organ, &c.
-ĭnss
for -ance and -ence; and
-ĭnt
for -ant and -ent, as
Abundinss, Rĕvĕrinss, Contentmĭnt, Commandmint,
&c. instead of Abundance, Reverence, Contentment, Commandment, &c.
-fŏol
for -ful as
Faithfoŏl,
&c.
iss
for ess, as
Heedlĭss, Hăppĭnĭss,
and a great abundance of such other syllables, equally distant from the true pronunciation.
As I have no other motive for giving my opinion so freely concerning this gentleman's performance, than the desire of removing all unnecessary difficulty from the learning of English, I hope he will excuse me; even though my remarks should not have sufficient weight to convince him.
He may likewise assure himself, that, though I think an uniformity of pronunciation throughout the British dominions is more to be wished than hoped for; yet I should have as much real satisfaction as himself in the completion of that
"great moral end,"
which (as he supposes in his preface) would be promoted thereby, viz. the removal of
national prejudice;
an effect equally to be desired by all lovers of their country, whether South or North Britons!
It would be much to the advantage of all those who learn the English tongue, if the syllables in all future editions of English dictionaries were divided according to the
A very useful little dictionary on this plan was printed in 1764, for J. Nourse and S. Hooper in the Strand, intituled, "the Complete English Spelling Dictionary upon an entire new Plan;" the author, Mr. J. Carter.
method recommended by Dr. Lowth and Mr. Gignoux before mentioned: and likewise if the words, which are not properly English, were distinguished by an asterisk, or some other particular mark placed before them; that foreigners may not conceive our language to be unnecessarily copious and difficult.
The coining of new words from other languages to express any thing, which might as concisely and elegantly be explained in proper English words, is a kind of pedantry, which all writers should endeavour to avoid: unless we be allowed to except those who treat of natural philosophy, medicine, surgery, or such other subjects as are supposed to be read by none but those who are acquainted with other languages, or at least have some knowledge of the Latin tongue. For it ought to be the study of every writer to make his meaning as plain and intelligible in the proper language in which he writes, as he possibly can. Yet so many of our most eminent writers have occasionally been guilty of the fault above mentioned, that the ingenious Mr. Johnson has thought himself obliged to insert a great abundance of such coined words into his excellent English dictionary; and the reverend Mr. Entick likewise into his very useful new pocket dictionary. But I cannot suppose that such kind of words were admitted by these gentlemen as proper English words; but merely that they might explain them to English readers; who without the knowledge of other languages cannot otherwise possibly understand them: which is a sufficient proof that they are not at all intitled to the name of English words.
For how should an English reader (I mean a reader merely of English) be supposed to understand that
Ablepsy
signifies blindness?
Acetosity
sourness?
Anhelation
panting?
Arcanum
a secret?
Obesity
fatness?
Papilio
a butterfly?
Neoterick,
modern?
Paranymph
a bride-man?
Rugose
wrinkled?
Squalor
nastiness?
Terreous
earthy?
Tenebricose
dark;
Tripudiation
dancing?
Tumefy
to swell?
Turm
a troop? and a thousand other such words, which are found in both dictionaries?
It is much to be wished that all such new coined words, which have only been used by a few authors, were distinguished by some mark from the common and proper English words (as I have hinted above) in all future editions of these useful dictionaries: lest so many uncouth and pedantick expressions should be adopted into the English tongue by dictionary authority. Because when a person sees them ranged with other words in an English dictionary, he may be induced to make use of them as proper English words in his writing and discourse, which would, at first, cause no small impediment to the understanding of his ordinary readers and hearers.
The accents used in these dictionaries are particularly useful for keeping up an uniformity in pronunciation; and it would be well if the double accents were also added to some particular words, as in Mr. Gignoux's spelling book for the purpose mentioned in page 7 of his preface, viz. To denote, that
the consonant that begins the next syllable must be also sounded at the end of the syllable where the double accent is; as a″-tóne-ment; man″-gle; in-tan″-gle; which words must be sounded as if written at-tone-ment; mang-gle; intang-gle;
so in con″-quer-or; con″-cu-bine; &c.
The same would also be particularly useful in words, wherein g and c are softened by the vowels e and i following them in the next syllable as in neg-lig″-ent; vo-rac″ity, &c.
In my search for such words as are independent of the following rules, I made use of the Rev. Mr. Entick's new spelling dictionary; and though I examined the same so carefully, that I believe I have not made many omissions, yet the whole number of particular exceptions (exclusive of their compounds and derivatives) amount to no more than
There are indeed 54 foreign words besides; (see page 15) which are not included in this number, because, as they still retain their original pronunciation (or nearly so) they cannot properly be accounted exceptions to English rules.
340—which number bears a very small proportion to the number of words in that dictionary; which I compute to be upwards of 23,000. This, I think, ought to prove that the English pronunciation is not so very irregular as it is generally thought to be; which a careful examination of the following pages will more particularly shew.
A SHORT TREATISE ON THE ENGLISH TONGUE.
THE English vowels, a, e, i, o and u, have each of them
The vowels may indeed be said to have more sounds than 2, because a different pronunciation from the 2 sounds here spoken of, is given to each of the vowels in a few particular cases, which are hereafter noted; but at present I am only speaking of their general power.
2
sounds,
commonly called
long
and
short.
The sounds of the three first vowels a, e, and i, when long, seem to be peculiar at present to this nation, wherefore they may properly be called the English sounds.
And the short sounds of these three vowels may, for the sake of distinction, be called the foreign sounds; because they are uttered with scarcely any difference (except that a and i, are pronounced short) from the French articulation of the same vowels; which shall be more fully explained by
See the examples to the 2d rule.
examples hereafter.
I think it necessary to observe in this place that the English sound of the following vowels, diphthongs and terminations cannot easily be expressed in foreign letters, and should therefore be learned by ear, viz.
i long
There are 2 ways of sounding the long i and y (though both long) the one a little different from the other, and requiring a little more extension of the mouth, as may be seen by comparing the following words, viz. I and Aye, High and High-ho; By't (or by it) and Bite; Sigh'd and Side; Strive and Strife, &c. but this difference being so nice, is not to be attained but by much practice, neither is it very material.
, as in Bi-ble, Mi-tre, Nitre, Pirate, &c.
o and u short, before a consonant in the same syllable as in Odd, Nod, Lord, &c. and in Mud, Strut, Stun, Urn, &c.
oi and oy, which have both the same sound, as in Oil, Boil, Coil, Boy, Coy, Hoy, &c.
ou and ow (not like the French ou, in the pronunciation of which the lips are almost closed, but) with an open articulation as in Pound, Our, Gown, Pow-er, &c.
Also the following Terminations, viz.
-ire
-tion
-cious
-tious
as in Dire, Fire, Salvation, Delicious, Fictitious, &c.
The English (or long) sound is given to the vowels a, e,
Rule I.
and i (and the other vowels are also sounded long) when they are alone, or when there is not a consonant following them in the same syllable (also before silent e in the end of a word; see the 3d rule)
Examples
a like the French e in Bête, as in Ca-ble, Fa-ble, Sa-ble, &c.
e like the French i in Mille, as in Be, He, E-vil, Be-ver, Le-gal, &c.
i like the Greek
At quoties litera i longa est plerumque effertur ut Graecorum
. See Wallis's Grammatica Linguae Anglicanae.
or something like the French i long before n in
Divin, Prince, Enfin,
&c. as in Bi-ble; Di-al; Fi-nal; Gi-ant, &c.
o like the French o or au, as in Go; So; Lo-cal; Mo-ment, &c.
u like ew in Few, Pew, &c. as in Du-ty, Fu-ry, Hu-man, &c.
y (when a vowel) like the English i; as in the monosyllables Buy and Guy, (wherein u is mute) Dry, Fry, My, Dye, &c. in the dissyllables, Ally′, Com-ply′, De-ny′, De-scry′, De-fy′, Es-py′, Im-ply′, Re-ly′, and Re-ply′, which are accented on the ultimate syllable; and in all words compounded with the Latin word Fio; as Dé-ify, Magnify, Specify, Rarify, &c.
(Particular Exceptions concerning
a,
at the End of a Syllable)
Except, 1st,
a in
Wa-ter,
wherein it is commonly pronounced like the French
a,
or English diphthong
aw;
in
Fa-ther,
and the last syllable of
Pa-pa, Mam-ma,
wherein it has a medium sound between
aw
and the English a; and in
a-ny,
and
ma-ny,
wherein it sounds like a short
e.
(Particular Exceptions concerning
i
)
2dly,
i in
ac-qui-esce, Bi-er, Pi-er,
and
Tier,
wherein it sounds like the English
e.
(General Exceptions concerning
i
)
3dly,
i is pronounced short before another vowel in the termination of all words of more than 2 syllables, when it is not radical; as in
A′mĭ-able, De-mo-nĭ-ac′k, Ca′r-rĭ-age, So′-cĭ-al, Wi′l-lĭ-am, Sty′g-ĭ-an, Da′l-lĭ-ance, Va′l-ĭ-ant, Spăn-ĭ-ard, A′-pĭ-ary, So′-cĭ-ate, In-sid-ia′tor, Al-le-vĭ a′tion, Ma′r-rĭ-ed, A-lĭ-en, Co′n-scĭ-ence, Am′-bĭ-ent, Gla-zĭ-er, Spe′-cĭ-es, Se-rag″-lĭ-o, Ax′-i-om, Pos-te′-rĭ-or, Wa′r-rĭ-our, Con′-scĭ-ous, I′d-ĭ-ot, Pre′-mĭ-um,
&c. But in the proper names

A′ffi′-ance,
and the derivatives from the dissyllables ending in
y,
which are mentioned in the example: as
Al-li′-ance, Com-pli′-ance, De-ni′-al, De-fi′-ance,
and
Re-li′-ance,
wherein the
i
When
i
is substituted for
y
in the terminations of derivatives, it retains the sound of the
y
in the original word, whether long or short; therefore
i
in
Cā r-rĭ-er, Cā r-rĭ-ed,
and
Cā r-rĭes,
is short; and in
Al-lī -ance, De-nī -al, Dig-ni fī -ed, Im-plī es,
&c. is pronounced long like the
y
in the primitive words before specified.

in the original words, and is accented accordingly.
Particular Exceptions concerning o.
Except, 4thly,

General Exception concerning y.
6thly,
y, at the end of all words of two or more syllables (except those mentioned in the example) is pronounced like a short
i,
as in
Carry, Envy, Commissary,
&c. the accent being laid on one of the former syllables.
Of vowels in syllables ending with a consonant.
ule II.
The vowels are pronounced short in all syllables ending with a consonant (except in the particular cases hereafter noted) and the three first vowels have the foreign articulation, without any other material difference, except that of being pronounced short.
EXAMPLES.
a has a short articulation of the English
aw,
or rather of the Italian
a,
as in
Add, Bad, Lad, Mad,
&c.
e has exactly the sound of the

French
i,
or English
e,
as in
Bid, Did, Hid, Kid,
&c.
The short sound of the two other vowels (viz.
o
and
u
) must be acquired by ear, as I have before observed (see examples of these vowels in p. 3. of this treatĭse.)
Particular Exceptions concerning
a
before a consonant.
Except, 1st,
a in
A′n-gel, Bass, Ca′m-brick, Ca′m-bridge, Da′n-ger,

&c.; though in
Wind,
the substantive, and its compounds, it is sometimes pronounced short.
It is also sounded long before
gh,
as in
High, Nigh, Light,
&c. in which
gh
is mute, having no other use than that of lengthening the
i.
It is long also before
gn
at the end of a word (and the
g
is mute) as in
Benign, Sign,

Rule III.
But when
e
or
ue
follow a consonant in the same syllable, the preceding vowel retains its original open or long sound.
EXAMPLES.
Ace, Face, Rece′de, Dice, Vote, Con-fu′te, Vague, Vogue, Col-le′gue,
&c. Also,
Ad-vice, De-vi′ce, En-ti′ce, Suf-fi′ce, Sac-rif-i′ce, Ali′ve, Con-ni′ve, Con-tri′ve, De-pri′ve, Deri′ve, Re-vi′ve,

two consonants,
when they are followed by
e
in the same syllable (except before
-nce
) as ĭn
Ache, Haste, Waste, Change, Grange, Range,
&c. and their compounds and derivatives; but the other four vowels are sounded short in the like case, as in

AN APPENDIX, CONTAINING A Brief ACCOUNT of the chief Peculiarities of the ENGLISH CONSONANTS.
1.
B
is mute before
t,
or after
m,
in the same syllable, as
Debt, Lamb,
&c.
2.
C
sounds soft, like
s,
when followed by
e, i,
or an apostrophe (denoting the absence of
e
) as
Cedar, City, Danc′d,
&c.
C
sounds like
sh,
when followed by
ea, ia, ie,
or
io,
making different syllables, as
Ocean, Ancient, Precious, Social,
&c. except
Society.
CC
when followed by
e
or
i,
sounds like
x,
as
Accept, Accident,
&c.
C
is mute in
Indict, Victuals, Scene, Scent, Science, Sciatica, Scissors, Scission, Scymiter, Scythe,
and the proper names
Scyros, Scylla,
and
Scythia.
In all other cases
C
sounds hard like
k.
3.
Ch,
when properly English, has the same sound with the Italian
c,
before
e
or
i.
Examp.
Child, Chain,
&c.
It sounds also like
sh,
in words derived from the French, as
Chaise, Champaigne,
&c. and like
k
in words of Greek extraction, as
Christ, School, Stomach, Archangel,
&c. pronounced
Ark-angel.
But if
Arch
comes before a consonant,
ch
has then its proper English sound, as in
Archbishop.
Ch
in
Loch
sounds like
f.
Ch
is mute in
Drachm, Schedule,
and
Schism.
4.
D
is mute before
ge,
as in
Judge, Bridge,
&c. also in
Soldier.
5.
F
in
Of
sounds like
v.
6.
G
sounds
soft
like
j
before
e, i,
or an
apostrophe,
and
hard
(like the Greek
y
) in all other cases.
Examp.
Angel, Rage, Rag′d, Giant, Ginger,
&c.
Exceptions to
G
′s sounding soft.
1. In the participles passive of words ending in
g hard
(and also where-ever
g
is doubled) it continues hard, notwithstanding the vowels
e
or
i,
or an apostrophe, as in
Dragg′d, Begging, Digging,
&c.
2. In the termination
ger,
where-ever it makes a distinct syllable,
g
sounds hard, as in
An″-ger, Fin″ger, Lon″ger, Stron″ger,
&c. in which kind of words it may be observed that the
g
sounds double, so as to belong to both syllables.
3. Derivatives in
er, ed,
or
ing
from primitives in
ng,
retain the
g
hard, as
Singing, Sing-er,
from
Sing; Hang-ing, Hang-er,
from
Hang; Winged
or
Wing′d
from
Wing,
&c. In which kind of words it may be observed, that
g
sounds
single,
and belongs to the
first syllable only.
4. In the following words
G
is hard, notwithstanding it comes before
e
or
i;
viz.
Geese, Gewgaw, Geld, Gelt, Gertrude, Get
(with its compounds)
Gibberish, Gibbous, Giddy, Gift, Gig, Giggle, Gild, Girl, Give, Forgive, Gilt, Gimblet, Gimp, Gird, Girt, Girdle, Begin, Gizzard, Gideon, Gibbons, Gilbert,
and
Gilpin.
G
is mute before
n
in the same syllable, as
Gnash, Sign, Sovereign,
&c. also in
Phlegm, Seraglio,
and
Bagnio.
7.
Gh
sounds like
G hard
in
Ghost,
and like
ff
in
Cough, Lough, Laugh, Laughter, Rough, Slough, Tough, Trough,
and
Enough.
In other words it is mute.
8.
H
is mute in
Hour, Honour, Honest, Heir, Herb, Humour, Hostler, Thyme, John, Thomas, Thomasin,
and
Thames.
Also in Greek words, when preceded by
R,
as
Rheum, Rhyme, Rhetoric, Myrrh,
&c. and lastly at the end of words, as
ah, hah, Isaiah, Sarah,
&c.
9.
K
is mute before
n
in the same syllable, as
Knave, Know, Knight,
&c.
10.
L
is mute in
Balk, Talk, Walk, Stalk, Balm, Calm, Calf, Calves, Falcon, Half, Halves, Holme
(an island) and
Holmes
(a surname)
Psalm, Qualm, Salmon, Could, Should,
and
Would.
11.
N
is mute after
m
in the same syllable, as
Hymn, Autumn, Solemn,
&c.
12.
P
is mute before
s,
and between
m
and
t,
as
Psalm, Tempt,
&c.
13.
Ph
is always sounded like
f,
except in
Stephen, Nephew,
and
Phial,
where it sounds like
v.
Ph
is mute in
Phthisic,
and is pronounced
Tizzic.
14.
Q
is always followed by
u,
and, when it begins a syllable, sounds like
cw,
by which (as Mr. Johnson observes) our Saxon ancestors well expressed it. But in terminations from the Latin
-quus,
and also in words of French extraction, it sounds like
k.
Examp.
Oblique, Antique, Quoif, Conquer, Risque, Traffique,
&c. some of which words are now more commonly spelt with
c
or
k,
as
Coif, Risk, Traffic,
&c.
15.
S
sounds like
z.
1st, In the third persons singular of all verbs, and the plural number of all nouns, as in
Has, Was, Tries, Bees, Times,
&c.

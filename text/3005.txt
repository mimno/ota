Baron
Barkeley
of
Barkeley Castle and Knight of the Order of the
Bathe
To the illustrious
Prince CHARLES.
My Noble Lord,
That I may present my excuse, why, (being a stranger to your Lordshippe) I offer this Poem to your Patronage, I plead this war rant; Men (who neuer saw the Sea, yet desire to behold that regi ment of waters,) choose some eminent Riuer, to guide them thither; and make that as it were, their Conduct, or Position: But the like ingenious means, has your fame arriued at my knowledge, receiuing it from some of worth, who both in contemplation, and practise, owe to your Honour their clearest service. I do not altogether look up at your title: The ancien'st Nobility, being but a rellique of time past, and the truest Honor indeede being for a man to conferre Honor on himself, which your Learning stiues to Propagate, and shall make you arrive at the Dignity of a great Example. I am confident this worke is no unworthy your Honors perusal for by such Poems as this, Poets haue kist the hands of Great Princes, and drawne their gentle eyes to looke downe upon their sheets of paper, when the Poets them selves were bound up in their wining-sheets. The like curtesie from your Lordship, shall make you liue in your graue, and laurell spring out of it when the ignorant scorners of the Muses (that like a wormes in Libraries, seem to liue only, to destroy learning) shall wither, neglected, and forgotten. This worke and my selfe I humbly present to your approued censure. It being the utmost of my wishes, to have your Honorable selfe my weighty and perspicuous Com ment: which grace so done me, shall euer be aknow ledged
By your Lordships in all duty and Obseruance,
Iohn Webster.
In the iust VVorth, of that well Deseruer, Mr. IOHN WEBSTER, and upon this Maister-peece of Tragœdy.
In this Thou imitat'st one Rich, and wise,
That sees His Good Deedes done before he dies;
As he by workes, Thou by this worke of Fame,
Ha'st well prouided for thy Liuing Name;
To trust to others Honorings, is worth's Crime,
Thy monument is rais'd in thy Life Time;
And 'tis most iust; for every Worthy Man
Is his owne Marble; and his Merit can
Cut Him to any figure, and express
More Art, then deaths Cathedrall Pallaces,
Where Royal Ashes keepe their Court: thy Note
Be euer Plainnes, 'tis the Richest Coate:
Thy Epitaph onely the Title Bee,
Write, Dutchesse, that will fetch a teare for thee,
For who e're saw this Dutchesse liue, and dye,
That could get off under a Bleeding Eye.
In Tragædiam. Vt Lux ex Tenebris ictu percussa TONANTIS; Illa, (Ruina Malis) claris fit Vita Poetis.
Thomas Middletonùs,
Poëta & Chron: Londinensis.
To his friend Mr Iohn Webster Vpon his Dutchesse of Malfy
I Neuer saw thy Dutchesse, till the day,
That she was Liuely body'd in the play;
How'ere she answer'd her low-rated Loue,
her brothers anger, did so fatal prooue,
Yet my opinion is, she might spoke more,
But (neuer in her life) so well before.
WIL: ROVVLEY.
To the Reader of the Authour, and his Dutchesse of Malfy.
Crowne him a poet, whom nor Rome, nor Greece,
Transcend in all their's, for a Master-peece:
In which, whiles words and matter change, and Men,
Act one another; hee, from whose cleare Pen.
They All tooke life, To Memory hath lent
A lasting Fame, to raise his Monument.

Scena Prima.
Antonio, and Delio, Bosola, Cardinall.
You are wel-come
to
your Country (deere Antonio)
You have bin long
in
France, and you returne
A very formall French-man,
in
your habit.
How do you
like
the French Court?
I admire
it
,
In
seeking
to
reduce both State, and People
To
a fix'd Order, their iuditious King
Begins at home: Quits first his Royall Pallace
Of flattring Sicophants of dissolute,
And infamous persons
which
he sweetely termes
His Masters Master-peece (the worke of Heauen)
Considring duely,
that
a Princes Court
Is
like
a common Fountaine, whence should flow,
Pure siluer-droppes ingenerall: But if
it
chance
Some curs'd example poyson
it
neere the head,
Death, and diseases through the whole land spread.
And what is
it
makes this blessed gouernment,
But a most prouident Councell,
who
dare freely
Informe him, the corruption of the times?
Though some of the Court hold
it
presumption
To
instruct Princes what they ought
to
do,
It
is a noble duety
to
informe them
What they ought
to
fore-see: Here comes Bosola
The onely Court-Gall: yet I obserue his rayling
Is not
for
simple loue of Piety:
Indeede he rayles at those things
which
he wants,
Would be as leacherous, couetous, or proud,
Bloody, or enuious, as any man,
If he had meanes
to
be
so
: Here is the Cardinall.
I do haunt you still.
So
.
I have done you
Better seruice then
to
be slighted thus:
Miserable age, where onely the reward
Of doing well, is the doing of
it
.
You inforce your merrit to-much.
I fell into the Gallies
in
your seruice,
Where,
for
two yeares together, I wore two Towells in stead of A shirt, with a knot
on
the shoulder, after the fashion of a Romaine Mantle: Slighted thus? I
will
thriue some way: Black-birds fatten best
in
hard weather: why not I,
In
these dogge dayes?
Would you become honest,
With all your diuinity, do but direct me the way
to
it
, I Have knowne many trauell farre
for
it
, and yet returne as Arrant knaues, as they went forth; because they carried Themselues alwayes a long with them; Are you gon? Some fellowes (they say) are possessed with the diuell, But this great fellow, were able
to
possesse the greatest Diuell, and make him worse.
He hath denied thee some suit?
He, and his brother, are
like
Plum-trees (
that
grow crooked Ouer standing-pooles) they are rich, and ore-laden with Fruite, but none but Crowes, Pyes, and Catter-pillers feede
On
them: Could I be one of their flattring Panders, I Would hang
on
their eares
like
a horse-leach, till I were full, and Then droppe off; I pray leaue me.
Who
would relie
upon
these miserable dependances,
in
expectation
to
Be aduanc'd to morrow? what creature, euer fed worse, then hoping Tantalus? nor euer did any man more fearfully, then he
that
hop'd
For
a pleadon: There are rewards
for
hawkes, and dogges, and When they have done
us
seruice; but
for
a Souldier,
that
hazards his Limbes
in
a battaile, nothing but a kind of Geometry, is his last Supportation.
Geometry?
Aye,
to
hand
in
a faire paire of slings, take his latter-swinge
in
the World,
upon
an honorable pare of Crowtches, from hospitall
To
hospitall, fare ye well Sir. And yet do not you scorne
us
,
for
Places
in
the Court, are but likes beds
in
the hospitall, where this Mans head lies at
that
mans foote, and
so
lower, and lower.
I knew this fellow (seuen yeares)
in
the Gallies,
For
a notorious murther, and
it
was thought The Cardinall suborn'd
it
: he was releas'd
By
the French Generall (Gaston de Foux) When he recouer'd Naples.
It
is great pitty
He should be thus neglected, I have heard
He is very valiant: This foule mellancholly
Will
poyson all his goodnesse,
for
(i
will
tell you)
If too immoderate sleepe, be truly sayd
To
be an inward rust vnto the soule;
It
then doth follow want of action
Breeds all blacke male-contents, and their close rearing
(
Like
mothes
in
cloath) do hurt
for
want of wearing.
SCENA II.
Antonio, Delio, Ferdinand, Cardinall, Dutchesse, Castruchio, Siluio, Rodocico, Grisolan, Bosola, Iulia, Cariola.
The Presence 'gins
to
fill, you promis'd me
To
make the partaker of the natures
Of some of your great Courtiers.
The Lord Cardinalls
And other strangers,
that
are now
in
Court,
I shall: here comes the great Calabrian Duke.
Who
tooke the Ring oftnest?
Antonia Bologna (my Lord)
Our
Sister Duchesse great Master of
her
houshold?
Giue him the Iewell: when shall
we
leaue this sportiue-action,
And fall
to
action indeed?
Me thinkes (my Lord)
You should not desire
to
go
to
war
in
person.
Now,
for
some grauity: why (my Lord?)
It
is fitting a Souldier arise
to
be a Prince, but not necessary
A Prince descend
to
be a Captaine?
Noe?
No
, (my Lord)
He were far better do
it
by
a Deputy.
Why should he not as well sleepe, or eate,
by
a Deputy?
This might take idle, offensiue, and base office from him,
Whereas the other depriues him of honour.
Beleeue my experience:
that
Realme is neuer long
in
quiet,
Where the Ruler, is a Souldier.
Thou toldst me
Thy wife could not endure fighting.
True (my Lord.)
And of a iest, she broke of a Captaine,
She met, full of wounds: I have forgot
it
.
She told him (my Lord) he was a pittifull fellow,
to
lie,
Like
the Children of Ismael all
in
Tents.
Why, there is a wit were able
to
vndoe
All the Chyrurgeons of the City,
for
although
Gallants should quarrell, and had drawne their weapons,
And were ready
to
goe
to
it
; yet
her
perswasions would
Make them put
up
.
That
she would (my Lord)
How do you
like
my Spanish Gennit?
He is all fire.
I am of Pliney's opinion, I thinke he was begot
by
the wind,
He runs, as if he were ballassed with Quick-siluer.
True (my Lord) he reeles from the Tilt often.
Ha, ha, ha.
Why do you laugh? Me thinks you
that
are Courtiers
Should be my touch-wood, take fire, when I giue fire;
That
is, laugh when I laugh, were the subiect neuer
so
wity,
True (my Lord) I my selfe have heard a very good iest,
And have scorn'd
to
seeme
to
have
so
silly a wit, as
to
vnderstand
it
.
But I can laugh at your Foole (my Lord.)
He cannot speake (you know) but he makes faces,
My Lady cannot abide him.
Noe?
Not endure
to
be
in
merry Company:
for
she saies
Too much laughing, and too much Company, fils
her
Too full of the wrinckle.
I would then have a Mathematicall Instrument made
for
Her
face,
that
she might not laugh out of compasse: I shall shortly
Visit you at Millaine (Lord Siluio.)
Your Grace shall arriue most wel-come.
You are a good Horse-man (Antonio) you have excellent
Riders
in
France, what do you thinke of good Horse-man-ship?
Noblely (my Lord) as out of the Grecian-horse, issued
Many famous Princes:
So
, out of braue Horse-man-ship,
Arise the first Sparkes of growing resolution,
that
raise
The minde,
to
noble action.
You have be-spoake
it
worthely.
Your brother, the Lord Cardinall, and sister Dutchesse.
Are the Gallies come about?
They are (my Lord.)
Here is the Lord Siluio, is come
to
take his leaue.
Now (Sir) your promise: what is
that
Cardinall?
I meane his Temper? they say he is a braue fellow,
Will
play his fiue thousand crownes, at Tennis, Daunce,
Court Ladies, and one
that
hath fought single Combats.
Some such flashes superficially hang
on
him,
for
forme:
But obserue his inward Character: he is a mellancholly
Church-man: The Spring
in
his face,is nothing but the
Ingendring of Toades: where he is iealious of any man,
He laies worse plots
for
them, then euer was impos'd
on
Hercules:
for
he strewes
in
his way Flatters, Panders,
Intelligencers, Athiests, and a thousand such politicall
Monsters: he should have beene Pope: but in stead of
Comming
to
it
,
by
the primatiue decensie of the church,
He did bestow bribes,
so
largely, and
so
impudently, as if he would
Have carried
it
away without heauens knowledge. Some good he
Hath done.
You have giuen too much of him: what is his brother?
The Duke there? a most peruerse, and turbulent Nature,
What appeares
in
him mirth, is meerely outside,
If he laugh hartely,
it
is
to
laugh
All honesty out of fashion.
Twins?
In
qualitie:
He speakes with others Tongues, and heares mens suites,
With others Eares:
will
seeme
to
sleepe
on
the bench
Onely
to
intrap offenders,
in
their answeres;
Doombes men
to
death,
by
information,
Rewards
by
heare-say.
Then the Law
to
him
Is
like
a fowle black cob-web,
to
a Spider,
He makes
it
his dwelling, and a prison
To
entangle those shall feede him.
Most true:
He neu'r paies debts, vnlesse they be shewed turnes,
And those he
will
confesse,
that
he doth owe,
Last:
for
his brother, there, (the Cardinall)
They
that
do flatter him most, say Oracles
Hang at his lippes: and verely I beleeue them:
For
the Diuell speakes
in
them.
But
for
their sister, (the right noble Duchesse)
You neuer fix'd your eye,
on
three faire Meddalls,
Cast
in
one figure, of
so
different temper:
For
her
discourse,
it
is
so
full of Rapture,
You onely
will
begin, then
to
be sorry
When she doth end
her
speech: and wish (
in
wonder)
She held
it
lesse vaine-glory,
to
talke much
Then your pennance,
to
heare
her
: whilst she speakes,
She throwes
upon
a man,
so
sweet a looke,
That
it
were able raise one
to
a Galliard
That
lay
in
a dead palsey; and
to
doate
On
that
sweete countenance: but
in
that
looke,
There speaketh
so
diuine a continence,
As cuts off all lasciuious, and vaine hope.
Her
dayes are practis'd
in
such noble vertue,
That
, sure
her
nights (nay more
her
very Sleepes)
Are more
in
Heauen, then other Ladies Shrifts.
Let all sweet Ladies, breake their flattring Glasses,
And dresse themselues
in
her
.
Fye Antonia,
You play the wire-drawer with
her
commendations.
I
will
case the picture
up
: onley thus much,
All
her
particular worth, growes
to
this somme:
She staines the time past: lights the time
to
come.
You must attend my Lady,
in
the gallery,
Some halfe an houre hence.
I shall.
Sister, I have a suit
to
you:
To
me, Sir?
A Gentleman here: Daniel de Bosola:
One,
that
was
in
the Gallies.
Yes, I know him:
A worthy fellow he is: pray let me entreat
for
The prouisorship of your horse.
Your knowledge of him,
Commends him, and prefers him.
Call him heither,
We
now
upon
parting: Good Lord Siluio
Do
us
commend
to
all
our
noble friends
At the Leagues.
Sir, I shall.
You are
for
Millaine?
I am:
Bring the Carroches:
we
will
bring you down
to
the Hauen.
Be sure you entertaine
that
Bosola
For
your Intelligence: I would not be seene
in
it
.
And therefore many times I have slighted him,
When he did court
our
furtherance: as this Morning.
Antonio, the great Master of
her
houshold
Had been farre fitter:
You are deceiu'd
in
him,
His Nature is too honest
for
such businesse,
He comes: I
will
leaue you.
I was lur'd
to
you.
My brother here (the Cardinall) could neuer abide you.
Neuer since he was
in
my debt.
May be some oblique character
in
your face, made him suspect you?
Doth he study Phisiognomie?
There is
no
more credit,
to
be giuen
to
the face,
Then
to
a sicke mans vryn,
which
some call
The Physitians whore, because she cozens him:
He did suspect me wrongfully:
For
that
You must giue great men leaue
to
take their times:
Distrust, doth cause
us
seldome be deceiu'd;
You see, the oft shaking of the Cedar-Tree
Fastens
it
more at roote.
Yet take heed:
For
to
suspect a friend vnworthely,
Instructs him the next way
to
suspect you,
And prompts him
to
deceiue you.
There is gold.
So
:
What followes? (Neuer raind such showres as these
Without thunderbolts
in
the taile of them;) whose throat must I cut?
Your inclination
to
shed blood, rides post
Before my occasion
to
vse you: I giue you
that
To
liue
in
the Court, here: and obserue the Duchesse,
To
note all the particulars of
her
hauiour:
What suitors do sollicite
her
for
marriage
And whom she best affects: she is a yong widowe,
I would not have
her
marry againe.
No
, Sir?
Do not you aske the reason: but be satisfied,
I say I would not.
It
seemes you would create me
One of your familiars.
Familiar? what is
that
?
Why, a very quaint inuisible Diuell,
in
flesh:
An Intelligencer.
Such a kind of thriuing thing
I would wish thee: and ere long, thou maist arriue
At a higher place
by
it
.
Take your Diuels
Which
Hell calls Angels: these curs'd gifts would make
You a corrupter, me an impudent traitor,
And should I take these they would take me Hell.
Sir, I
will
take nothing from you,
that
I have giuen;
There is a place,
that
I procur'd
for
you
This morning: (the Prouisor-ship of the horse)
Have you heard out?
Noe.
It
is yours, is
it
not worth thankes?
I would have you curse your selfe now,
that
your bounty
(
Which
makes men truly noble) ere should make
Me a villaine: o,
that
to
auoid ingratitude
For
the good deed you have done me, I must do
All the ill man can inuent: Thus the Diuell
Candies all sinnes are: and what Heauen termes vild,
That
names he complementall.
Be your selfe:
Keepe your old garbe of melencholly:
it
will
expresse
You enuy those
that
stand aboue your reach,
Yet striue not
to
come neere them: This
will
gaine
Accesse,
to
priuate lodgings, where your selfe
May (
like
a pollitique dormouse,
As I have seene some,
Feed
in
a Lords dish, halfe a sleepe, not seeming
To
listen
to
any talke: and yet these Rogues
Have cut his throat
in
a dreame: what is my place?
The Prouisors-ship of the horse? say then my corruption
Grew out of horse-doong: I am your creature.
Away.
Let good men,
for
good deeds, couet good fame,
Since place, and riches oft are bribes of shame
Sometimes the Diuell doth preach.
Exit Bosola.
We
are
to
part from you: and your owne discretion
Must now be your director.
You are a Widowe:
You know already what man is: and therefore
Let not youth: high promotion, eloquence,
No
, nor any thing without the addition, Honor,
Sway your high blood.
Marry? they are most luxurious,
Will
wed twice.
O fie:
Their liuers are more spotted
Then Labans sheepe.
Diamonds are of most value
They say;
that
have past through most Iewellers hands.
Whores,
by
that
rule, are precious:
Will
you heare me?
I
will
neuer marry:
So
most Widowes say:
But commonly
that
motion lasts
no
longer
Then the turning of an houreglasse, the funeral Sermon,
And
it
, end both together.
Now heare me:
You liue
in
a ranke pasture here,
in
the Court,
There is a kind of honney-dew,
that
is deadly:
It
will
poyson your fame; looke
to
it
: be not cunning:
For
they whose faces do belye their hearts,
Are Witches, ere they arriue at twenty yeeres,
Aye: and giue the diuell sucke.
This is terrible good councell:
Hypocrisie is wouen of a fine small thred,
(Subtler, then Vulcans Engine: yet (beleeu
it
)
Your darkest actions: nay, your priuat'st thoughts,
Will
come
to
light.
You may flatter your selfe,
And take your owne choice: priuately be married
Vnder the Eues of night.
Think
it
the best voyage
That
ere you made;
like
the irregular Crab,
Which
though
it
goes backward, thinkes
that
it
goes right,
Because
it
goes its owne way, but obserue;
Such weddings, may more properly be said
To
be executed, then celibrated.
The marriage night
Is the entrance into some prison.
And those ioyes,
Those lustfull pleasures, are
like
heauy sleepes
Which
do fore-run mans mischiefe
Fare you well.
Wisdome begins at the end: remember
it
.
I thinke this speech betweene you both was studied,
It
came
so
roundly off.
You are my sister,
This was my Fathers Poyniard: do you see,
I would be loth
to
see
it
looke rusty, 'cause
it
was his:
I would have you
to
giue ore these chargeable Reuels;
A Vizor, and a Masque are whispering roomes
That
were neu'r built
for
goodnesse: fare ye well:
And woemen,
like
that
part,
which
(
like
the Lamprey)
Hath neu'r a bone
in
it
.
Fye Sir:
Nay,
I meane the Tongue: varietie of Courtship;
What cannot a neate knaue with a smooth tale,
Make a woman beleeue? farewell, lusty Widowe.
Shall this moue me? if all my royall kindred
Lay
in
my way, vnto this marriage:
I would make them my low foote-steps: And euen now,
Euen
in
this hate (as men
in
some great battailes
By
apprehending danger, have atchieu'd
Almost impossible actions: I have heard Souldiers say
so
,
So
I, through frights, and threatnings,
will
assay
This dangerous venture: Let old wiues report
I wincked, and chose a husband: Cariola,
To
thy knowne secricy, I have giuen
up
More then my life, my fame:
Both shall be safe:
For
I
will
conceale this secret from the world
As warily as those
that
trade
in
poyson,
Keepe poyson from their children.
Thy protestation
Is ingenious, and hearty: I beleeue
it
.
Is Antonio come?
He attends you:
Good deare soule,
Leaue me: but place thy selfe behind the Arras,
Where thou maist ouer-heare
us
: wish me good speed
For
I am going into a wildernesse,
Where I shall find nor path, nor friendly clewe
To
be my guide, I sent
for
you, Sit downe:
Take Pen and Incke, and write: are you ready?
Yes:
What did I say?
That
I should write some-what.
O, I remember:
After this triumphs, and this large expence
It
is fit (
like
thrifty husbands)
we
enquire
What is laid
up
for
to morrow:
So
please your beauteous Excellence.
Beauteous? Indeed I thank you; I look yong
for
your sake.
You have tane my cares
upon
you.
I
will
fetch your Grace the
Particulars of your reuinew, and expence.
O, you are an upright treasurer: but you mistooke,
For
when I said I meant
to
make enquiry,
What is layd
up
for
to morrow: I did meane
What is layd
up
yonder
for
me.
Where?
In
Heauen,
I am making my
will
, (as
it
is fit Princes should
In
perfect memory) and I pray Sir, tell me
Were not one better make
it
smiling, thus?
Then
in
deepe groanes, and terrible ghastly lookes,
As if the guifts
we
parted with procur'd
That
violent distruction?
O, much better.
If I had a husband now, this care were quit:
But I intend
to
make you Ouer-seer;
What good deede, shall
we
first remember? say.
Begin with
that
first good deed, began
in
the world,
After mans creation, the Sacrament of marriage,
I'ld have you first prouide
for
a good husband,
Giue him all.
All?
Yes, your excellent selfe.
In
a winding sheete?
In
a cople.
St Winfrid,
that
were a strange
will
.
It
were strange if there were
no
will
in
you
To
marry againe.
What do you thinke of marriage?
I take
it
, as those
that
deny Purgatory,
It
locally containes, or heauen, or hell,
There is
no
third place
in
it
.
How do you affect
it
?
My banishment, feeding my mellancholly,
Would often reason thus.
Pray let
us
heare
it
.
Say a man neuer marry, nor have children,
What takes
that
from him? onely the bare name
Of being a father, or the weake delight
To
see the little wanton, ride a cocke-horse
Upon
a painted sticke, or heare him chatter
Like
a taught Starling.
Fye, fie, what is all this?
One of your eyes is blood-shot, vse my Ring
to
it
,
They say
it
is very soueraigne,
it
was my wedding Ring,
And I did vow neuer
to
part with
it
,
But
to
my second husband.
You have parted with
it
now.
Yes,
to
helpe your eye-sight.
You have made me starke blind.
How?
There is a sawcy, and ambitious diuell
Is dauncing
in
this circle.
Remooue him.
How?
There needs small coniuration, when your finger
May do
it
: thus, is
it
fit?
What sayd you?
he kneeles
Sir,
This goodly roofe of yours, is too low built,
I cannot stand vpright
in
it
, nor discourse,
Without I raise
it
higher: raise your selfe,
Or if you please, my hand
to
helpe you:
so
.
Ambition (Madam) is a great mans madnes,
That
is not kept
in
chaines, and close-pent-roomes,
But
in
fair lightsome lodgings, and is girt
With the wild noyce of pratling visitans,
Which
makes
it
lunatique, beyond all cure,
Conceiue not, I am
so
stupid, but I ayme
Whereto your fauours tend: But he is a foole
That
(being a cold) would thrust his hands
in
the fire
To
warme them.
So
, now the ground is broake,
You may discouer what a wealthy Mine,
I make you Lord of.
O my vnworthinesse.
You were ill
to
sell your selfe,
This darkning of your worth, is not
like
that
,
Which
trades-men vse
in
the City, their false lightes
Are
to
rid bad wares off: and I must tell you
If you
will
know where breathes a compleat man,
(I speake
it
without flattery) turne your eyes,
And progresse through your selfe.
Were there nor heauen, nor hell,
I should be honest: I have long seru'd vertue,
And neu'r tane wages of
her
.
Now she paies
it
,
The misery of
us
,
that
are borne great,
We
are forc'd
to
woe, because none dare woe
us
:
And as a Tyrant doubles with his words,
And fearefully equiuocates:
so
we
Are forc'd
to
expresse
our
violent passions
In
ridles, and
in
dreames, and leaue the path
Of simple vertue,
which
was neuer made
To
seeme the thing
it
is not: Goe, go brag
You have left me heartlesse, mine is
in
your bosome,
I hope
it
will
multiply loue there: You do tremble:
Make not your heart
so
dead a peece of flesh
To
feare, more then
to
loue me: Sir, be confident,
What is
it
distracts you? This is flesh, and blood, (Sir,)
It
is not the figure cut
in
Allablaster
Kneeles at my husbands tombe: Awake, awake (man)
I do here put off all vaine ceremony,
And onely do appeare
to
you, a yong widow
That
claimes you
for
her
husband, and
like
a widow,
I use but halfe a blush
in
it
.
Truth speake
for
me,
I
will
remaine the constant Sanctuary
Of your good name.
I thanke you (gentle loue)
And 'cause you shall not come
to
me,
in
debt,
(Being now my Steward) here
upon
your lippes
I signe your
Quietus est
: This you should have beg'd now,
I have seene children oft eate sweete-meates thus,
As fearefull
to
devoure them too soone.
But
for
your Brothers?
Do not thinke of them,
All discord, without this circumference,
Is onely
to
be pittied, and not fear'd:
Yet, should they know
it
, time
will
easily
Scatter the tempest.
These words should be mine,
And all the parts you have spoke, if some part of
it
Would not have savour'd flattery.
Kneele.
Hah?
Be not amaz'd, this woman is of my Councell,
I have heard Lawyers say, a contract
in
a Chamber,
(
Per verba presenti
) is absolute marriage:
Blesse (Heauen) this sacred Gordian,
which
, let violence
Neuer vntwine.
And may
our
sweet affections, (
like
the Sphears)
Be still
in
motion.
Quickning, and make
The
like
soft Musique.
That
we
may imitate the louing Palmes
(Best Embleme of a peacefull marriage)
That
neu'r bore fruite deuided.
What can the Church force more?
That
Fortune may not know an accident
Either of ioy, or sorrow,
to
deuide
Our
fixed wishes.
How can the Church build faster?
We
now are man, and wife, and
it
is the Church
That
must but eccho this: Maid, stand a part,
I now am blinde.
What is your conceit
in
this?
I would have you leade your Fortune
by
the hand,
Vnto your marriage bed:
(You speake
in
me this,
for
we
now are one)
We
will
onely lie, and talke together, and plot
To
appease my humorous kindred; and if you please
(
Like
the old tale,
in
Alexander and Lodowicke)
Lay a naked sword betweene
us
, keepe
us
chast:
O, let me shrowd my blushes
in
your bosome,
Since
it
is the treasury of all my secrets.
Whether the spirit of greatnes, or of woman
Raigne most
in
her
, I know not, but
it
shewes
A fearefull madnes, I owe
her
much of pitty.
Exeunt.
ACTVS II.
SCENA I.
Bosola, Castruchio, an Old Lady, Antonio, Delio, Duchesse, Rodorico, Grisolan.
You say you would faine be taken
for
an eminent Courtier?
It
is the very maine of my ambition.
Let me see, you have a reasonable good face
for
it
already, And your night-cap expresses your ears sufficient largely, I would have you learne
to
twitle the strings of your band with a Good grace, and
in
a set speech, (at the end of euery sentence,)
To
hum, three, or foure times, or blow your nose (till
it
smart againe,)
To
recouer your memory, when you come
to
be a president
in
Criminall causes, if you smile
upon
a prisoner, hang him, but if You frowne
upon
him, and threaten him, let him be sure
to
scape The Gallowes.
I would be a very merrie president,
Do not sup a nights,
it
will
beget you an admirable wit.
Rather
it
would make me have a good stomake
to
quarrel,
For
they say, your roaring-boyes eate meate seldome,
And
that
makes them
so
valiant:
But how shall I know whether the people take me
For
an eminent fellow.
I
will
teach a tricke
to
know
it
,
Giue out you lie a dying, and if you
Heare the common people curse you,
Be sure you are taken
for
one of the prime night-caps,
You come from painting now?
From what?
Why, from your scuruy face-physicke,
To
behold thee not painted enclines somewhat neere
A miracle: These
in
thy face here, were deepe rutts,
And foule sloughes the last progresse:
There was a Lady
in
France,
that
hauing had the small pockes,
Flead the skinne off
her
face,
to
make
it
more leuell;
And whereas before she look'd
like
a Nutmeg-grater,
After she resembled an abortiue hedge-hog.
Do you call this painting?
No
,
no
, but you call carreening of an old
Morphew'd Lady,
to
make
her
disembogue againe
There is rough-cast phrase
to
your plastique.
It
seemes you are well acquainted with my closset?
One would suspect
it
for
a shop of witch-craft,
To
finde
in
it
the fat of Serpents; spawne of Snakes, Iewes spittle,
And their yong children ordures, and all these
for
the face:
I would sooner eate a dead pidgeon, taken from the soles of the feete
Of one sicke of the plague, then kisse one of your fasting:
Here are two of you, whose sin of your youth, is the very
Patrimony of the Physition, makes him renew his
Foote-cloth with the Spring, and change his
High-priz'd curtezan with the fall of the leafe:
I do wonder you do not loath your selues,
Obserue my meditation now:
What thing is
in
this outward forme of man
To
be belou'd?
we
account
it
ominous,
If Nature do produce a Colt, or Lambe,
A Fawne, or Goate,
in
any limbe resembling
A Man; and flye from
it
as a prodegy.
Man stands amaz'd
to
see his deformity,
In
any other Creature but himselfe.
But
in
our
owne flesh, though
we
beare diseases
Which
have their true names, onely tane from beasts,
As the most vlcerous Woolfe, and swinish Meazeall;
Though
we
are eaten
up
of lice, and wormes,
And though continually
we
beare about
us
A rotten and dead body,
we
delight
To
hide
it
in
rich tissew all
our
feare,
(Nay all
our
terrour) is, least
our
Phisition
Should put
us
in
the ground,
to
be made sweete.
Your wife has gone
to
Rome: you two cople, and get you
To
the wels at Leuca,
to
recouer your aches.
I have other worke
on
foote: I obserue
our
Duchesse
Is sicke a dayes, she puykes,
her
stomacke seethes,
The sins of
her
eie-lids, looke most teeming blew,
She waines
in
the cheeke, and waxes fat
in
the flanke;
And (contrary
to
our
Italian fashion,)
Weares a loose-bodied Gowne, there is somewhat
in
it
I have a tricke, may chance discouer
it
(A pretty one) I have bought some Apricocks,
The first
our
Spring yeelds.
And
so
long since married?
You amaze me.
Let me seale your lipps for euer,
For
did I thinke,
that
any thing but the ayre,
Could carry these words from you, I should wish
You had
no
breath at all: Now Sir,
in
your contemplation?
You are studdying
to
become a great wise fellow?
O Sir, the opinion of wisedome, is a foule tettor,
That
runs all ouer a mans body: if simplicity
Direct
us
to
have
no
euill,
it
directs
us
to
a happy
Being:
For
the subtlest folly proceedes from the
Subtlest wisedome: Let me be simply honest.
I do vnderstand your in-side.
Do you
so
?
Because you would not seeme
to
appeare
to
the world
Puff'd
up
with your preferment: You continue
This out of fhashion mellancholly, leaue
it
, leaue
it
.
Giue me leaue
to
be honest
in
any phrase,
in
any
Complement whatsoeuer, shall I confesse my selfe
to
you?
I looke
no
higher then I can reach:
They are the gods,
that
must ride
on
winged horses,
A Lawyers mule of a slow pace,
will
both suit
My disposition, and businesse:
For
(marke me)
When a mans mind rides faster then his horse can gallop,
They quickly both tyre.
You would looke
up
to
Heauen, but I thinke
The Diuell,
that
rules
in
the aire, stands
in
your light.
O (Sir) you are Lord of the ascendant,
Chiefe man with the Duchesse, a Duke was your
Cosen German, remou'd: Say you were lineally
Descended from King Pippin, or he himselfe,
What of this? search the heads of the greatest riuers
in
The World, you shall find them but bubles of water:
Some would thinke the soules of Princes were brought
Forth
by
some more weighty cause, then those of meaner persons,
They are deceiu'd, there is the same hand
to
them:
The
like
passions sway them, the same reason,
that
makes
A Vicar goe
to
Law
for
a tithe-pig,
And vndoe his neighbours, makes them spoile
A whole Prouince, and batter downe goodly
Cities, with the Cannon.
Your arme Antonio, do I not grow fat?
I am exceeding short-winded: Bosola,
I would have you (Sir) prouide
for
me a Littor,
Such a one, as the Duchesse of Florence roade
in
.
The Duchesse us'd one, when she was great with childe.
I thinke she did: come hether, mend my ruffe,
Here, when? thou art such a tedious Lady; and
Thy breath smells of Lymmon pils, would thou hadst done,
Shall I sound vnder thy fingers? I am
So
troubled with the mother.
I feare too much.
I have heard you say,
that
the French Courties
Weare their hats
on
fore the King.
I have seene
it
.
In
the Presence?
Yes:
Why should not
we
bring
up
that
fashion?
It
is ceremony more then duty,
that
consists
In
the remoouing of a peece of felt:
Be you the example
to
the rest of the Court,
Put
on
your hat first.
You must pardon me:
I have seen,
in
colder countries, then
in
France,
Nobles stand bare
to
the Prince; and the distinction
My thought show'd reuerently.
I have a present
for
your Grace.
For
me sir?
Apricocks (Madam.)
O sir, where are they?
I have heard of none
to
yeare.
Good,
her
colour rises.
Indeed I thanke you: they are wondrous faire ones:
What an vnskilfull fellow is
our
Gardiner?
We
shall have none this moneth.
Will
not your Grace pare them?
No
, they tast of muske (me thinkes) indeed they do:
I know not: yet I wish your Grace had parde them:
Why?
I forgot
to
tell you the knaue Gardner,
(Onely
to
raise his profit
by
them the sooner)
Did ripen them
in
horse-doung.
O you iest:
You shall iudge: pray tast one.
Indeed Madam,
I do not loue the fruit.
Sir, you are loath
To
rob
us
of
our
dainties:
it
is a delicate fruit,
They say they are restoratiue?
It
is a pretty
Art: this grafting.
It
is
so
: a bettring of nature.
To
make a pippin grow
upon
a crab,
A dampson
on
a black thorne: how greedily she eats them?
A whirlewinde strike off these bawd-farthingalls,
For
, but
for
that
, and the loose-bodied gowne,
I should have discouer'd apparently
The young spring-hall cutting a caper
in
her
belly.
I thanke you (Bosola:) they were right good ones,
If they do not make me sicke.
How now Madame?
This greene fruit and my stomake are not friends
How they swell me?
Nay, you are too much swell'd already.
O, I am
in
an extreame cold sweat.
I am very sorry:
Lights
to
my chamber: O, good Antonio
I feare I am vndone.
Exit Duchesse.
Lights there, lights.
O my most trusty Delio,
we
are lost:
I feare she is falne
in
labour: and there is left
No
time
for
her
remoue.
Have you prepar'd
Those Ladies
to
attend
her
? and procur'd
That
politique safe conueyance
for
the Mid-wife
Your Duchesse plotted.
I have:
Make use then of this forc'd occasion:
Giue out
that
Bosola hath poyson'd
her
,
With these Apricocks:
that
will
giue some colour
For
her
keeping close.
Fye, fie, the Physitians
Will
then flocke
to
her
.
For
that
you may pretend
She
will
vse some prepar'd Antidote of
her
owne,
Least the Physitians should re poyson
her
.
I am lost
in
amazement: I know not what
to
think of
it
.
Ex.
SCENA II.
Bosola, old Lady, Antonio, Rodorigo, Grisolan: Seruants, Delio, Cariola.
So
,
so
: there is
no
question but
her
teatchiues
And most vulterous eating of the Apricocks, are apparant
Signes of breeding, now?
I am
in
hast (Sir.)
There was a young wayting-woman, had a monstrous desire
To
see the Glasse-house.
Nay, pray let me goe:
And
it
was onely
to
know what strange instrument
it
was,
Should swell
up
a glasse
to
the fashion of a womans belly.
I
will
heare
no
more of the Glasse-house,
You are still abusing woemen?
Who
I?
no
, onely (
by
the way now and then) mention Your fraileties. The Orrenge tree beare ripe and greene Fruit, and blossoms altogether: And some of you giue entertainment
For
pure loue: but more,
for
more precious reward. The lusty Spring smels well: but drooping Auntumne tasts well: If
we
Have the same golden showres,
that
rained
in
the time of Iupiter The Thunderer: you have the same Danes still,
to
hold
up
their Laps
to
receiue them: didst thou neuer study the Mathematiques?
What is
that
(Sir.)
Why,
to
know the trick how
to
make many lines meete
In
one center: Goe goe; giue your foster-daughters good councell: Tell them,
that
the Diuell takes delight
to
hang at a womans girdle,
Like
a false rusty watch
that
she cannot discerne how The time passes.
Shut
up
the Court gates:
Why sir? what is the danger?
Shut
up
the Posterners presently: and call
All the Officers of the Court.
I shall instantly:
Who
keepes the key of the Parke-gate?
Forobosco.
Let him bring
it
presently.
O, Gentlemen, of the Court, the fowlest treason.
If
that
these Apricocks should be poysond, now;
Without my knowledge.
There was taken euen now a Switzer
In
the Duchesse Bed-chamber.
A Switzer?
With a Pistoll
in
his great cod-piece.
Hh, ha, ha.
The cod-piece was the case
for
it
.
There was a cunning traitor.
Who
would have search'd his cod-piece?
True, if he had kept out of the Ladies chambers:
And all the mowldes of his buttons, were leaden bullets.
O wicked Caniball: a fire-lock
in
his cod-piece?
It
was a French plot
upon
my life.
To
see what the Diuell can do.
All the Offices here?
We
are:
Gentlemen,
We
have lost much Plate you know; and but this euening
Iewels,
to
the value of foure thousand Duckets
Are missing
in
the Duchesse Cabinet,
Are the Gates shut?
Yes.
It
is the Duchesse pleasure
Each Officer be lock'd into his chamber
Till the Sun-rysing: and
to
send the keyes
Of all their chests, and of their outward doores
Into
her
bed-chamber: She is very sicke.
At
her
pleasure.
She intreates you take
it
not ill: The Innocent
Shall be the more approu'd
by
it
.
Gentleman of the Wood-yard, where is your Switzer now?
By
this hand
it
was creadably reported
by
one of the Blackguard.
How fares
it
with the Duchesse?
She is expos'd
Vnto the worst of torture, paine, and feare;
Speake
to
her
all happy comfort.
How I do play the foole with mine own danger?
You are this night (deere friend)
to
poast
to
Rome,
My life lies
in
your seruice.
Do not doubt me.
O,
It
is farre from me: and yet feare presents me
Somewhat
that
looke
like
danger.
Beleeue
it
,
It
is but the shadow of your feare,
no
more:
How superstitiously
we
mind
our
euils?
The throwing downe salt, or crossing of a Hare;
Bleeding at nose, the stumbling of a horse
Or singing of a Criket, are of powre
To
daunt whole man
in
us
: Sir, fare you well:
I wish you all the ioyes of a bless'd Father;
And (
for
my faith) lay this vnto your brest,
Old friends (
like
old swords) still are trusted best.
Sir, you are the happy father of a sonne,
Your wife commends him
to
you.
Blessed comfort:
For
heauen-sake tend
her
well: I
will
presently
Goe set a figure
for
his Natiuitie.
Exeunt.
SCENA III.
Bosola, Antonio.
Sure I did heare a woman shreike: list, hah?
And the sound came (if I receiu'd
it
right)
From the Dutchesse lodgings: there is some stratagem
In
the consyning all
our
Courtiers
To
their seuerall wards: I must have part of
it
,
My Intelligence
will
freize else: List againe,
It
may be
it
was the mellencholly bird,
(Best friend of silence, and of solitarines)
The Oowle,
that
schream'd
so
: hah? Antonio?
I heard some noyse:
who
is there? what art thou? speake.
Antonio? Put not your face; nor body
To
such a forc'd expression of feare,
I am Bosola; your friend.
Bosola?
(This Moale does vndermine me) heard you not
A noyce euen now?
From whence?
From the Duchesse lodging.
Not I: did you?
I did: or else I dream'd.
Let
us
walke towards
it
.
No
:
It
may be,
it
was
But the rising of the winde:
Very likely:
Me thinkes
it
is very cold, and yet you sweat.
You looke wildly.
I have been setting a figure
For
the Duchesse Iewells;
Ah: and how falls your question?
Do you find
it
radicall?
What is
that
to
you?
It
is rather
to
be question'd what designe
(When all men were commanded
to
their lodgings)
Makes you a night-walker.
In
sooth I
will
tell you:
Now all the Court is asleepe, I thought the Diuell
Had least
to
do here; I came
to
say my prayers,
And if
it
do offend you, I do
so
,
You are a fine Courtier.
This fellow
will
vndoe me;
You gaue the Duchesse Apricocks to day,
Pray Heauen they were not poysond?
Poysond? a spanish figge
For
the imputation.
Traitors are euer confident,
Till they are discouer'd: There were Iewels stolne too,
In
my conceit, none are
to
be suspected
More then your selfe.
You are a false steward.
Sawcy slaue: I
will
pull thee
up
by
the rootes;
May be the ruyne
will
crush you
to
peeces.
You are an impudent snake indeed (sir)
Are you scarce warme, and do you shew your sting?
You Libell well (sir.)
No
(sir,)
Copy
it
out: and I
will
set my hand
to
it
.
My nose bleedes: One
that
were superstitious, would count
This ominous: when
it
merely comes
by
chance.
Two letters,
that
are wrought here,
for
my name
Are drown'd
in
blood: meere accident:
for
you (sir) I
will
take order:
In
the morne you shall be safe:
it
is
that
must colour
Her
lying-in: sir, this doore you passe not:
I do not hold
it
fit,
that
you come neere
The Duchesse lodgings, till you have quite your selfe;
The Great are
like
the Base; nay, they are the same,
When they seeke shamefull waies,
to
auoid shame.

This is a parcell of Intelligency

A Letter,

SCENA. IIII.
Cardinall,and Iulia,Seruant,and Delio.
Sit: thou art my best of wishes, pre-thee tell me
What tricke didst thou inuent
to
come
to
Rome,
Without thy husband.
Why, (my Lord) I told him
I came
to
visit an old Anchorite
Here,
for
deuotion
Thou art a witty false one:
I meane
to
him.
You have preuailed with me
Beyond my strongest thoughts: I would not now
Find you inconstant.
Do not put thy selfe
To
such a voluntary torture:
which
proceedes
Out of your owne guilt.
How (my Lord?)
You feare my constancy, because you have approou'd
Those giddy and wild turning
in
your selfe.
Did you ere find them?
Sooth generally
for
woemen;
A man might striue
to
make glasse male-able,
Ere he should make them fixed.
So
, (my Lord)
We
had need goe borrow
that
fantastique glasse
Inuented
by
Galileo the Florentine,
To
view an other spacious world
in
the Moone,
And looke
to
finde a constant woman there.
This is very well (my Lord.)
Why do you weepe?
Are teares your iustification? the selfe-same teares
Will
fall into your husbands bosome, (Lady)
With a loud protestation,
that
you loue him
Aboue the world: Come, i
will
loue you wisely,
That
is iealously, since I am very certaine
You cannot me make cuckould.
I
will
go home
To
my husband.
You may thanke me, (Lady)
I have taken you off your mellancholly pearch,
Boare you
upon
my fist, and shew'd you 'game,
And let you flie at
it
: I pray thee kisse me,
When thou wast with thy husband, thou wast watch'd
Like
a tame Ellephant: (still you are
to
thanke me)
Thou hadst onely kisses from him, and high feeding,
But what delight was
that
?
it
was iust
like
one
That
hath a little fingring
on
the Lute.
Yet cannot tune
it
: (still you are
to
thanke me.)
You told me of a piteous wound
in
the heart,
And a sicke liuour, when you woed me first,
And spake
like
one
in
physicke.
Who
is
that
?
Rest firme,
for
my affection
to
thee,
Lightning mooues slow
to
it
.
(Madam) a Gentleman
That
is come post from Malfy, desires
to
see you.
Let him enter, i
will
with-draw.
Exit.
He sayes,
Your husband (old Castruchio) is come
to
Rome,
Most pittifully tyrd with riding post.
Signior Delio?
it
is one of my old Suitors.
I was bold
to
come and see you.
Sir, you are wel-come.
Do you lie here?
Sure, your owne experience
Will
satisfie you
so
,
our
Romane Prelates
Do not keepe lodging,
for
Ladies.
Very well:
I have brought you
no
commendations from your husband,
For
I know none
by
him.
I heare he has come
to
Rome?
I neuer knew man, and beast, of a horse, and a knight,
So
weary of each other, if he had had a good backe,
He would have vndertooke
to
have borne his horse,
His breech was
so
pittifully sore.
Your laughter,
Is my pitty.
Lady, I know not whether
You want mony, but I have brought you some.
From my husband?
No
, from mine owne allowance.
I must heare the condition, ere I be bound
to
take
it
.
Looke
on
it
,
it
is gold, hath
it
not a fine colour?
I have a Bird more beautifull.
Try the sound of
it
.
A Lute-string far exceedes
it
,
It
hath
no
smell,
like
Cassia, or cyuit,
Nor is
it
phisicall, though some fond Doctors
Perswade
us
, seeth's
in
Cullisses, i
will
tell you,
This is a Creature bred
by
--
Your husband has come,
Hath deliuer'd a letter
to
the Duke of Calabria,
that
,
To
my thinking hath put him out of his wits.
Sir, you heare,
'Pray let me know your busines, and your suite,
As briefely as can be.
With good speed, I would wish you
(At such time, as you are non-resident
With your husband) my mistris.
Sir, i
will
go aske my husband if I shall,
And straight returne your answere.
Exit.
Very fine,
Is this
her
wit, or honesty
that
speakes thus?
I heard one say the Duke was highly mou'd
With a letter sent from Malfy: I do feare
Antonio is betray'd: how fearefully
Shewes his ambition now, (vnfortunate Fortune)
They passe through whirle-pooles, and deepe woes do shun,
Who
the euent weigh, ere the action is done.
Exit.
SCENA V.
Cardinall, and Ferdinand, with a letter.
I have this night dig'd
up
a man-drake.
Say you?
And I am growne mad with
it
.
What is the progedy?
Read there, a sister dampn'd, she is loose
in
the hilts:
Growne a notorious Strumpet.
Speake lower.
Lower?
Rogues do not whisper
it
now, but seeke
to
publish
it
,
(As Seruants do the bounty of their Lords)
Aloud; and with a couetuous searching eye,
To
marke
who
note them: O confusion sease
her
,
She hath had most cunning baudes
to
serue
her
turne,
And more secure conueyances
for
lust,
Then Townes of garrison,
for
Seruice.
Is
it
possible?
Can this be certaine?
Rubarbe, o,
for
rubarbe
To
purge this choller, here is the cursed day
To
prompt my memory, and here
it
shall sticke
Till of
her
bleeding heart, I made a spunge
To
wipe
it
out.
Why do you make your selfe
So
wild a Tempest?
Would I could be one,
That
I might tosse
her
pallace 'bout
her
eares,
Roote
up
her
goodly forrests, blast
her
meades,
And lay
her
generall territory as wast,
As she hath done
her
honors.
Shall
our
blood?
(The royall blood of Arragon, and Castile)
Be thus attaincted?
Apply desperate physicke,
We
must not now vse Balsamum, but fire,
The smarting cupping-glasse,
for
that
is the meane
To
purge infected blood, (such blood as hers:)
There is a kind of pitty
in
mine eie,
I
will
giue
it
to
my hand-kercher; and now
it
is here,
I
will
bequeath this
to
her
Bastard.
What
to
do?
Why,
to
make soft lint
for
his mother wounds,
When I have hewed
her
to
peeces.
Curs'd creature,
Vnequall nature,
to
place womens hearts
So
farre
upon
the left-side.
Foolish men,
That
ere
will
trust their honour
in
a Barke,
Made of
so
slight, weake-bull-rush, as is woman,
Apt euery minnit
to
sinke
it
?
Thus
Ignorance, when
it
hath purchas'd honour,
It
cannot weild
it
.
Me thinkes I see
her
laughing.
Excellent Hyenna, talke
to
me somewhat, quickly,
Or my imagination
will
carry me
To
see
her
,
in
the shamefull act of sinne.
VVith whom?
Happily, with some strong thigh'd Bargeman;
Or one the wood-yard,
that
can quoit the fledge,
Or tosse the barre, or else some louely Squire
That
carries coles
up
,
to
her
priuy lodgings.
You flie beyond your reason.
Goe
to
(Mistris.)
It
is not your whores milke,
that
shall quench my wild-fire,
But your whores blood.
How idlely shewes this rage?
Which
carries you, as men conuar'd
by
witches, through the ayre,
On
violent whirle-windes, this intemperate noyce,
Fitly resembles deafe-mens shrill discourse,
Who
talke aloud, thinking all other men
To
have their imperfection.
Have not you,
My palsey?
Yes, I can be angry
Without this rupture, there is not
in
nature
A thing,
that
makes man
so
deform'd,
so
beastly,
As doth intemperate anger: chide your selfe,
You have diuers men,
who
neuer yet exprest
Their strong desire of rest, but
by
vnrest,
By
vexing of themselues: Come, put your selfe
In
tune.
So
, I
will
onely study
to
seeme
The thing I am not: I could kill
her
now,
In
you, or
in
my selfe,
for
I do thinke
It
is some sinne
in
us
, Heauen doth reuenge
By
her
.
Are you starke mad?
I would have their bodies
Burn't
in
a coale-pit, with the ventage stop'd,
That
their curs'd smoake might not ascend
to
Heauen:
Or dippe the sheetes they lie
in
,
in
pitch or sulphure,
Wrap them
in
it
, and then light them
like
a match:
Or else
to
boile their Bastard
to
a cullisse,
And giue
it
his leacherous father,
to
renew
The sinne of his backe.
I
will
leaue you.
Nay, I have done,
I am confident, had I been damn'd
in
hell,
And should have heard of this,
it
would have put me
Into a cold sweat:
In
,
in
, i
will
go sleepe,
Till I know
who
leapes my sister, i
will
not stirre:
That
knowne, i
will
find Scorpions
to
string my whips,
And fix
her
in
a generall ecclipse.
Exeunt.
ACTVS III.
SCENA I.
Antonio, and Delio, Duchesse, Ferdinand, Bosola.
Our
noble friend (my most beloued Delio)
O, you have been a stranger long at Court,
Came you along with the Lord Ferdinand?
I did Sir, and how faires your noble Duchesse?
Right fortunately well: She is an excellent
Feeder of pedegrees: since you last saw
her
,
She hath had two children more, a sonne, and daughter.
Me thinkes
it
was yester-day: Let me but wincke,
And not behold your face,
which
to
mine eye
Is somewhat leaner, verily I should dreame
It
were within this halfe houre.
You have not been
in
Law, (friend Delio)
Nor
in
prison, nor a Suitor at the Court
Nor beg'd the reuersion of some great mans place,
Nor troubled with an old wife,
which
doth make
Your time
so
insencibly hasten.
Pray Sir tell me,
Hath not this newes arriu'd yet
to
the eare;
Of the Lord Cardinall?
I feare
it
hath,
The Lord Ferdinand (
that
is newly come
to
Court,)
Doth beare himselfe right dangerously.
Pray why?
He is
so
quiet,
that
he seemes
to
sleepe
The tempest out (as Dormise do
in
Winter,)
Those houses,
that
are haunted, are most still,
Till the diuell be
up
.
What say the common people.
The common-rable, do directly say
She is a Strumpet.
And your grauer heades,
(
Which
would be pollitique) what censure they?
They do obserue, I grow
to
infinite purchase
The least-hand way, and all suppose the Duchesse
Would amend
it
, if she could:
For
, say they
Great Princes, though they grudge their Officers
Should have such large, and vnconfined meanes
To
get wealth vnder them,
will
not complaine
Least thereby they should make them odious
Vnto the people,
for
other obligation
Of loue, or marriage, betweene
her
and me,
They neuer dreame of.
The Lord Ferdinand
Is going
to
bed.
I
will
instantly
to
bed,
For
I am weary: I am
to
be be-speake
A husband
for
you.
For
me (Sir?) 'pray
who
is
it
?
The great Count Malateste.
Fie
upon
him,
A Count? he is a meere sticke of sugar-candy,
(You may looke quite thorough him) when I choose
A husband, I
will
marry
for
your honour.
You shall do well
in
it
: How is
it
(worthy Antonio?)
But (Sir) I am
to
have priuate conference with you,
About a scandalous report, is spread
Touching mine honour.
Let me be euer deafe
to
it
:
One of Pasquils paper-bullets, court calumney,
A pestilent ayre,
which
Princes pallaces
Are seldome purg'd of: Yet, say
that
it
were true,
I powre
it
in
your bosome, my fix'd loue,
Would strongly excuse, extenuate, nay deny
Faults where they apparant
in
you: Goe be safe
In
your owne innocency.
O bless'd comfort,
This deadly aire is purg'd.
Exeunt.
Her
guilt treads
on
Hot burning cultures: Now Bosola,
How thriues
our
intelligence?
(Sir) vncertainly,
It
is rumour'd she hath had three bastards, but
By
whom,
we
may go read
in
the Starres.
Why some
Hold opinion, all things are written there.
Yes, if
we
could find Spectacles
to
read them,
I do suspect, there hath been some Sorcery
Vs'd
on
the Duchesse.
Sorcery,
to
what purpose?
To
make
her
doate
on
some desertles fellow,
She shames
to
acknowledge.
Can your faith, giue way
To
thinke there is powre
in
potions, or
in
Charmes,
To
make
us
loue, whether
we
will
or
no
?
Most certainely.
Away, these are meere gulleries, horred things
Inuented
by
some cheating mounte-banckes
To
abuse
us
: Do you thinke
that
hearbes, or charmes
Can force the
will
? Some trialls have been made
In
this foolish practise; but the ingredients
Were lenatiue poysons, such as are of force
To
make the patient mad; and straight the witch
Sweares (
by
equiuocation, they are
in
loue.
The witch-craft lies
in
her
rancke bood: this night
I
will
force confession from
her
: You told me
You had got (within these two dayes) a false key
Into
her
Bed-chamber.
I have.
As I would wish.
What do you intend
to
do?
Can you guesse?
No
:
Do not aske then:
He
that
can compasse me, and know my drifts,
May say he hath put a girdle 'bout the world,
And sounded all
her
quick-sands.
I do not
Thinke
so
.
What do you thinke then? pray?
That
you are
Your own Chronicle too much: and grosly
Flatter your selfe.
Giue me thy hand, I thanke thee:
I neuer gaue Pention but
to
flatterers,
Till I entertained thee: farewell,
That
Friend a Great mans ruine strongely checks,
Who
railes into his beliefe, all his defects.
Exeunt.
SCENA. II
Dutchesse, Antonio, Cariola, Ferdinand, Bosola, Officers.
Bring me the Casket hither, and the Glasse;
You get
no
lodging here, to night (my Lord.)
Indeed, I must perswade one:
Very good:
I hope
in
time
it
will
grow into a custome,
That
Noble men shall come with cap, and knee,
To
purchase a nights lodging, of their wiues.
I must lye here.
Must? you are a Lord of Misse-rule.
Indeed, my Rule is onely
in
the night.
To
what vse
will
you put me,
We
will
sleepe together:
Alas, what pleasure can two Louers find
in
sleepe?
My Lord, I lye with
her
often: and I know
She
will
much disquiet you:
See, you are complain'd of.
For
she is the sprawlingst bedfellow.
I shall
like
her
the better
for
that
.
Sir, shall I aske you a question?
I pray thee Cariola.
Wherefore still when you lie with my Lady
Do you rise
so
early?
Labouring men,
Count the Clocke oftnest Cariola,
Are glad when their task is ended.
I
will
stop your mouth.
Nay,
that
is but one, Venus had two soft Doues
To
draw
her
Chariot: I must have another:
When wilt thou marry, Cariola?
Neuer (my Lord.)
O fie
upon
this single life: forgoe
it
:
We
read how Daphne,
for
her
peeuish flight
Became a fruitlesse Bay-tree: Siriux turn'd
To
the pale empty Reede: Anaxarate
Was frozen into Marble: whereas those
Which
married, or prou'd kind vnto their friends
Were,
by
a gracious influence, transhap'd
Into the Oliffe, Pomgranet, Mulbery:
Became Flowres, precious Stones, or eminent Starres.
This is a vaine Poetry: but I pray you tell me,
If there were propos'd me, Wisdome, Riches, and Beauty,
In
three seuerall young men,
which
should I choose?
It
is a hard question: this was Paris case
And he was blind
in
it
, and there was great cause:
For
how was
it
possible he could iudge right,
Hauing three amorous Goddesses
in
view,
And they starcke naked:
it
was a Motion
Were able
to
be-night the apprehention
Of the seveerest Counsellor of Europe.
Now I looke
on
both your faces,
so
well form'd
It
puts me
in
mind of a question, I would aske.
What is
it
?
I do wonder why hard-fauour'd Ladies
For
the most part, keepe worse-fauour'd waieting women,
To
attend them, and cannot endure faire ones.
O,
that
is soone answer'd.
Did you euer
in
your life know an ill Painter
Desire
to
have his dwelling next doore
to
the shop
Of an excellent Picture-maker?
it
would disgrace
His face-making, and vndoe him: I pre-thee
When were
we
so
merry? my haire tangles.
Pray-thee (Cariola) let
us
steale forth the roome,
And let
her
talke
to
her selfe: I have diuers times
Seru'd
her
the
like
, when she hath chafde extreamely:
I loue
to
see
her
angry: softly Cariola.
Exeunt.
Doth not the colour of my haire 'gin
to
change?
When I waxe gray, I shall have all the Court,
Powder their haire, with Arras,
to
be
like
me:
You have cause
to
loue me, I entred you into my heart
Before you would vouchsafe
to
call
for
the keyes.
We
shall one day have my brothers take you napping:
Me thinkes his Presence (being now
in
Court)
Should make you keepe your owne Bed: but you
will
say
Loue mixt with feare, is sweetest: I
will
assure you
You shall get
no
more children till my brothers
Consent
to
be your Ghossips: have you lost your tongue?
it
is welcome:
For
know whether I am doomb'd
to
liue, or die,
I can do both
like
a Prince.
Ferdinand gives
her
a ponyard.
Die then, quickle:
Vertue, where art thou hid? what hideous thing
Is
it
,
that
doth ecclipze thee?
'Pray sir heare me:
Or is
it
true, thou art but a bare name,
And
no
essentiall thing?
Sir:
Do not speake.
No
sir:
I
will
plant my soule
in
mine eares,
to
heare you.
O most imperfect light of humaine reason,
That
mak'st
so
vnhappy,
to
fore see
What
we
can least preuent: Pursue thy wishes:
And glory
in
them: there is
in
shame
no
comfort,
But
to
be past all bounds, and sence of shame.
I pray sir, heare me: I am married,
So
:
Happily, not
to
your liking: but
for
that
Alas: your sheeres do come vntimely now
To
clip the birds wings,
that
is already flowne:
Will
you see my Husband?
Yes, if I
Could change eyes with a Basilisque:
Sure, you came hither
By
his consideracy.
The howling of a Wolfe
Is musicke
to
the (schrech-Owle) pre'thee peace:
What ere thou art,
that
hast enioy'd my sister,
(
For
I am sure thou hearst me)
for
thine owne sake
Let me not know thee: I came hither, prepar'd
To
worke thy discouery: yet am now perswaded
It
would beget such violent effects
As would dampe
us
both: I would not
for
ten Millions
I had beheld thee: therefore vse all meanes
I neuer may have knowledge of thy name;
I enioy thy lust still, and a wretched life,
On
that
condition: And
for
thee (vilde woman,)
If thou do wish thy Leacher may grow old
In
thy Embracements, I would have thee build
Such a roome
for
him, as
our
Anchorites
To
holier vse enhabite: Let not the Sunne
Shine
on
him, till he is dead: Let Dogs, and Monkeys
Onely conuerse with him, and such dombe things
To
whom Nature denies vse,
to
sound his name.
Do not keepe a Paraqueto, least she learne
it
;
If thou do loue him, cut out thine owne tongue
Least
it
bewray him.
Why might not I marry?
I have not gone about,
in
this,
to
create
Any new world, or custome.
Thou art vndone:
And thou hast ta'ne
that
massiy sheete of lead
That
hid thy husbands bones, and foulded
it
About my heart.
Mine bleedes
for
it
.
Thine? thy heart?
What should I nam
it
, vnlesse a hollow bullet
Fill'd with vnquenchable wild-fire?
You are,
in
this
Too strict: and were you not my Princely brother
I would say too wilfull: My reputation
Is safe.
Dost thou know what reputation is
I
will
tell thee,
to
small purpose, since the instruction
Comes now too late:
Upon
a time Reputation, Loue, and Death,
Would trauell ore the world: and
it
was concluded
That
they should part, and take three seuerall wayes:
Death told them, they should find him
in
great Battailes:
Or Cities plagu'd with plagues: Loue giues them councell
To
enquire
for
him 'mongst unambitious shepheards,
Where dowries were not talk'd of: and sometimes
'Mongst quiet kindred,
that
had nothing left
By
their dead Parents: stay (quoth Reputation)
Do not forsake me:
for
it
is my nature
If once I part from any man I meete
I am neuer found againe: And
so
,
for
you:
You have shooked hands with Reputation,
And made him inuisible:
So
fare you well.
I
will
neuer see you more.
Why should onely I,
Of all the other Princes of the World
Be cas'd-vp,
like
a holy Relique? I have youth,
And a litle beautie.
So
you have some Virgins,
That
are Witches: I
will
neuer see thee more.
Exit.
You saw this apparition.
Enter Antonio with a Pistoll.
Yes:
we
are
Betraid; how came he hither? I should turne
This,
to
thee,
for
that
.
Pray sir do: and when
That
you have cleft my heart, you shall read there,
Mine innocence:
That
Gallery gaue him entrance.
I would this terrible thing would come againe,
That
(standing
on
my Guard) I might relate
My warrantable loue: ha, what meanes this?
He left this with me:
she shewes the poniard.
And
it
seemes, did wish
You would vse
it
on
your selfe?
His Action
Seem'd
to
intend
so
much.
This hath a handle
to
it
,
As well as a point, turne
it
towards him,
And
so
fasten the keene edge,
in
his rancke gall:
How now?
who
knocks? more Earthquakes?
I stand
As if a Myne, beneath my feete, were ready
To
be blowne
up
.
It
is Bosola.
Away,
O misery, me thinkes vniust actions
Should weare these masques, and curtaines; and not
we
:
You must instantly part hence: I have fashion'd
it
already.
Ex. Ant.
The Duke your brother is ta'ne
up
in
a whirlewind
Hath tooke horse, and his rid poast
to
Rome.
So
late?
He told me (as he mounted into the sadle,)
You were vndone.
Indeed, I am very neere
it
.
What is the matter?
Antonio, the master of
our
house-hold
Hath dealt
so
falsely with me,
in
his accounts:
My brother stood engag'd with me
for
money
Ta'ne
up
of certaine Neopolitane Iewes,
And Antonio to let's the Bonds be forfeyt.
Strange: this is cunning:
And hereupon
My brothers Bills at Naples are protested
Against: call
up
our
Officers.
I shall.
Exit.
The place
that
you must flye
to
, is Ancona,
Hire a howse there. I
will
send after you
My Treasure, and my Iewils:
our
weake safetie
Runnes
upon
engenous wheeles: short sillables,
Must stand
for
periods: I must now accuse you
Of such a fained crime, as Tasso calls
Magnanima Mensogna: A Noble Lie,
'Cause
it
must shield
our
honors: harke they are comming.
Will
your Grace heare me?
I have got well
by
you: you have yeelded me
A million of losse; I am
like
to
inherit
The peoples curses
for
your Stewardship:
You had the tricke,
in
Audit time
to
be sicke,
Till I had sign'd your
Quietus
; and
that
cur'de you
Without helpe of a Doctor. Gentlemen,
I would have this man be an example
to
you all:
So
shall you hold my fauour: I pray let him;
For
he has done
that
(alas) you would not thinke of,
And (because I intent
to
be rid of him)
I meane not
to
publish: vse your fortune else-where.
I am strongely arm'd
to
brooke my ouer-throw,
As commonly men beare with a hard yeere:
I
will
not blame the cause of
it
; but do thinke
The necessitie of my maleuolent starre
Procure this, not
her
humour: O the inconstant,
And rotten ground of seruice, you may see:
It
is eu'n
like
him,
that
in
a winter night
Takes a long slumber, ore a dying fire;
A-loth
to
part from
it
: yet parts thence as cold,
As when he first sat downe.
We
do confiscate
(Towards the satisfying of your accounts)
All
that
you have.
I am all yours: and
it
is very fit
All mine should be
so
.
So
, sir; you have your Passe.
You may see (Gentlemen) what
it
is
to
serue
A Prince with body, and soule.
Exit.
Here is an example,
for
extortion; what moysture, is drawne out of the Sea, when fowle weather comes, powres downe, and runnes into the Sea againe.
I would know what are your opinions of this Antonio.
He could not abide
to
see a Pigges head gaping,
I thought your Grace would finde him a Iew:
I would you had been his Officer,
for
your owne sake.
You would have had more money.
He stop'd his eares with blacke wooll: and
to
(those came
To
him
for
money) said he was thicke of hearing.
Some said he was an hermophrodite,
for
he could not abide a woman.
How scuruy prowd he would looke, when the Treasury was full:
Well, let him goe:
Yes, and the chippings of the Buttrey fly after him,
To
scowre his gold Chaine.
Exeunt.
Leaue
us
: what do you thinke of these?
That
these are Rogues,
that
in
his prosperitie,
But
to
have waited
on
his fortune, could have wish'd
His durty Stirrop riuited through their noses:
And follow'd after his Mule,
like
a Beare
in
a Ring.
Would have prostituted their daughters,
to
his Lust:
Made their first-borne and Intelligencers: thought none happy
But such as were borne vnder his bless'd Plannet:
And wore his Liuory: and do these Lyce drop off now?
Well, neuer looke
to
have the
like
againe;
He hath left a sort of flattring rogues, behind him,
Their doombe must follow: Princes pay flatterers,
In
their owne money: Flatterers dissemble their vices,
And they dissemble their lies,
that
is iustice:
Alas, poore gentleman,
Poore? he hath amply fill'd his cofers.
Sure he was too honest: Pluto the god of riches,
When he is sent (
by
Iupiter)
to
any man
He goes limping,
to
signifie
that
wealth
That
comes
on
god's name, comes slowly, but when he is sent
On
the diuells arrand, he rides poast, and comes
in
by
scuttles:
Let me shew you, what a most vnualu'd iewell,
You have (
in
a wanton humour) throwne away,
To
blesse the man shall find him: He was an excellent
Courtier, and most faithfull, a souldier,
that
thought
it
As beastly
to
know his owne value too little,
As deuillish
to
acknowledge
it
too much,
Both his vertue, and forme, deseru'd a farre better fortune:
His discourse rather delighted
to
iudge it selfe, then shew it selfe.
His breast was fill'd with all perfection,
And yet
it
seem'd a priuate whispring roome.
It
made
so
little noyse of
it
.
But he was basely descended.
Will
you make your selfe a mercinary herald,
Rather
to
examine mens pedegrees, then vertues?
You shall want him,
For
know an honest states-man
to
a Prince,
Is
like
a Cedar, planted
by
a Spring,
The Spring bathes the trees roote, the gratefull tree,
Rewards
it
with his shadow: you have not done
so
,
I would sooner swim
to
the Bermoothes
on
two Politisians
Rotten bladders, tide together with an Intelligencers hart-string
Then depend
on
so
changeable a Princes fauour.
Fare-thee-well (Antonio) since the mallice of the world
Would needes downe with thee,
it
cannot be sayd yet
That
any ill happened vnto thee, considering thy fall,
Was accompanied with vertue.
O, you render me excellent Musicke.
Say you?
This good one
that
you speake of, is my husband.
Do I not dreame? can this ambitious age
Have
so
much goodnes
in
it
, as
to
prefer
A man, meerely
for
worth: without these shadowes
Of wealth, and painted honors? possible?
I have had three children
by
him.
Fortunate Lady.
For
you have made your priuate nuptiall bed
The humble, and faire Seminary of peace,
No
question but: many an vnbenific'd Scholler
Shall pray
for
you,
for
this deed, and reioyce
That
some preferment
in
the world can yet
Arise from merit. The virgins of your land
(
That
have
no
dowries) shall hope, your example
Will
raise them
to
rich husbands: Should you want
Souldiers
it
would make the very Turkes and Moores
Turne Christians, and serue you
for
this act.
Last, the neglected Poets of your time,
(
In
honour of this trophee of a man
Rais'd
by
that
curious engine, (your white hand)
Shall thanke you,
in
your graue
for
it
; and make
that
More reuerend then all the Cabinets
Of liuing Princes:
For
Antonio
His fame, shall likewise flow, from many a pen,
When Heralds shall want coates,
to
sell
to
men.
As I taste comfort,
in
this friendly speech,
So
would I finde concealement.
O the secret of my Prince,
Which
I
will
weare
on
the in-side of my heart.
You shall take charge of all my coyne, and iewels,
And follow him,
for
he retires himselfe
To
Ancona.
So
.
Whether, within few days
I meane
to
follow thee.
Let me thinke:
I would wish your Grace,
to
faigne a Pilgrimage
To
our
Lady of Loretto, (scarce seauen leagues
From faire Ancona)
so
may you depart
Your Country, with more honour, and your flight
Will
seeme a Princely progresse, retaining
Your vsuall traine about you.
Sir, your direction
Shall lead me,
by
the hand.
In
my opinion,
She were better progresse
to
the bathes
At Leuca, or go visit the Spaw
In
Germany,
for
(if you
will
beleeue me)
I do not
like
this iesting with religion,
This faigned Pilgrimage.
Thou art a superstitious foole,
Prepare
us
instantly
for
our
departure:
Past sorrowes, let
us
moderately lament them,
For
those
to
come, seeke wisely,
to
preuent them.
Exit.
A Politician is the diuells quilted anvell,
He fashions all sinnes
on
him, and the blowes
Are neuer heard, he may worke
in
a Ladies Chamber,
(As here
for
proofe) what rests, but I reueale
All
to
my Lord? o, this base quality
Of Intelligencer? why, euery Quality
in
the world
Preferres but gaine, or commendation:
Now
for
this act, I am certaine
to
be rais'd,
And men
that
paint weedes, (
to
the life) are prais'd.
Exit.
SCENA III
Cardinall, Ferdinand, Mallateste, Pescara, Siluio, Delio, Bosola.
Must
we
turne Souldier then?
The Emperour,
Hearing your worth
that
way, (ere you attain'd
This reuerend garment,) ioynes you
in
commission
With the right fortunate souldier, the Marquis of Pescara,
And the famous Lanoy.
He
that
had the honour
Of taking the French King Prisoner?
The same,
Here is a plot drawne,
for
a new Fortification,
At Naples.
This great Count Malastete, I perceiue
Hath got employment?
No
employment (my Lord)
A marginall note
in
the muster-booke,
that
he is
A voluntary Lord.
He is
no
Souldier?
He has worne gun-powder,
in
his hollow tooth,
for
the tooth-ache.
He comes
to
the leaguer, with a full intent,
To
eate fresh beefe, and garlicke, meanes
to
stay
Till the sent begon, and straight returne
to
Court.
He hath read all the late seruice,
As the City Chronicle relates
it
,
And keepe two Pewterers going, onely
to
expresse
Battailes
in
modell.
Then hel; fight
by
the booke.
By
the Almanacke, I thinke
To
choose good dayes, and shun the Criticall,
That
is his mistris skarfe.
Yes, he protests
He would do much
for
that
taffita,
I think he would run away from a battaile
To
saue
it
from taking prisoner.
He is horribly afraid,
Gun-powder
will
spoile the perfume of
it
,
I saw a Duch-man breake his pate once
For
calling him pot-gun, he made his head
Have a boare
in
it
,
like
a musket.
I would he had made a touch-hole
to
it
.
He is indeede a guarded sumpter-cloath
Onely
for
the remooue of the Court.
Bosola arriu'd? what should be the businesse?
Some falling out amongst the Cardinalls.
These factions amongst great men, they are
like
Foxes, when their heards are deuided
They carry fire
in
their tailes, and all the Country
About them, goes
to
wracke
for
it
.
What is
that
Bosola?
I knew him
in
Padua, a fantasticall scholler,
Like
such,
who
studdy
to
know how many knots was
in
Hercules club, or what colour Achilles beard was,
Or whether Hector were not troubled with the tooth-ach,
He hath studdied himselfe halfe bleare-ei'd,
to
know the
True semitry of Cæsars nose
by
a shooing-horne, and this
He did
to
gaine the name of a speculatiue man.
Marke Prince Ferdinand,
A very Salamander liues
in
his eye,
To
mocke the eager violence of fire.
That
Cardinall hath made more bad faces with his oppression
Then euer Michael Angelo made good ones,
He lifts
up
his nose,
like
a fowle Por-pisse before a storme,
The Lord Ferdinand laughes.
Like
a deadly Cannon,
That
lightens ere
it
smoakes.
These are your true pangues of death,
The pangues of life,
that
strugle with great states-men,
In
such a deformed silence, witches whisper their charmes.
Doth she make religion
her
riding hood
To
keepe
her
from the sun, and tempest?
That
:
that
damnes
her
: Me thinkes
her
fault, and
Beauty blended together, shew
like
leaprosie
The whiter, the fowler: I make
it
a question
Whether
her
beggerly brats were euer christned.
I
will
instantly sollicite the state of Ancona
To
have them banish'd.
You are
for
Loretto?
I shall not be at your Ceremony: fare you well,
Write
to
the Duke of Malfy, my yong Nephew,
She had
by
her
first husband, and acquaint him,
With his mothers honesty.
I
will
.
Antonio?
A slaue,
that
onely smell'd of yncke, and coumpters,
And neu'r
in
his
like
, look'd
like
a Gentleman,
But
in
the audit time, go, go presently,
Draw me out a hundreth and fifty of
our
horse,
And meete me at the fort-bridge.
Exeunt.
SCENA IIII.
Two Pilgrims to the Shrine of our Lady of Loretto.
I have not seene a goodlier Shrine then this,
Yet I have visited many.
The Cardinall of Arragon
Is, this day
to
resigne his Cardinals hat,
His sister Duchesse likewise is arriu'd
To
pay
her
vow of Pilgrimage, I expect
A noble Ceremony.
No
question: -- They come.
Here the Ceremony of the Cardinalls enstalment,
in
the habit a Souldier: perform'd
in
deliuering
up
his Crosse, Hat, Robes, and Ring, at the Shrine; and inuesting him with Sword, helmet, Shield, and Spurs: then Antonio, the Duchesse, and their Children, (hauing presented themselues at the Shrine) are (
by
a forme of Banishment
in
dumbe-shew, expressed towards them
by
the Cardinall, and the State of Ancona) banished: During all
which
Ceremony, this Ditty is sung (
to
very sollemne Musique)
by
diuers Church-men; and then Exeunt.
The Author disclaimes this Ditty
to
be his.
Armes, and Honors, decke thy story,
To
thy Fames eternall glory,
Aduerse Fortune euer flie thee,
No
disastrous fate come nigh thee.
I alone
will
sing thy praises,
Whom
to
honour, vertue raises;
And thy study,
that
diuine is,
Bent
to
Marshiall discipline is:
Lay aside all those robes lie
by
thee,
Crown thy arts, with armes: they
will
beautifie thee.
O worthy of worthiest name, adorn'd
in
this manner,
Lead brauely thy forces
on
, vnder wars warlike banner:
O mayst thou proue fortunate,
in
all Marshiall courses,
Guide thou still,
by
skill,
in
artes, and forces:
Victory attend thee nigh whilst fame sings loud thy powres,
Triumphant conquest crowne thy head, and blessings prowre downe
showres.
Here is a strange turne of state,
who
would have thought
So
great a Lady, would have match'd her selfe
Vnto
so
meane a person? yet the Cardinall
Beares himselfe much too cruell.
They are banish'd.
But I would aske what power hath this state
Of Ancona,
to
determine of a free Prince?
They are a free state sir, and
her
brother shew'd
How
that
the Pope fore-bearing of
her
loosenesse,
Hath seaz'd into the protection of the Church
The Dukedome,
which
she held as dowager.
But
by
what iustice?
Sure I thinke
by
none,
Only
her
brothers instigation.
What was
it
, with such violence he tooke
Off from
her
finger?
It
was
her
wedding ring,
Which
he vow'd shortly he would sacrifice
To
his reuenge.
Alasse Antonio,
If
that
a man be thrust into a well,
No
matter
who
sets hand
to
it
, his owne weight
Will
bring him sooner
to
the bottome: Come, let
us
hence.
Fortune makes this conclusion generall,
All things do helpe the unhappy man
to
fall.
Exeunt.
SCENA V.
Antonio, Duchesse, Children, Cariola, Seruants, Bosola, Souldiers, with Vizards.
Banish'd Ancona?
Yes, you see what powre
Lightens
in
great mens breath.
Is all
our
traine
Shrunke
to
this poore remainder?
These poore men,
(
Which
have got little
in
your seruice) vow
To
take your fortune: But your wiser buntings
Now they are fledg'd are gon.
They have done wisely,
This puts me
in
minde of death, Physitians thus,
With their hands full of money, vse
to
giue ore
Their Patients.
Right the fashion of the world,
From decaide fortunes, euery flatterer shrinkes,
Men cease
to
build, where the foundation sinkes.
I had a very strange dreame to night.
What was
it
?
Me thought I wore my Coronet of State
And
on
a sudaine all the Diamonds
Were chang'd
to
Pearles.
My Interpretation
Is, you
will
weepe shortly,
for
to
me, the pearles
Do signifie your teares:
The Birds,
that
liue
in
the field
On
the wilde benefit of Nature, liue
Happier then
we
;
for
they may choose their Mates,
And carroll their sweet pleasures
to
the Spring:
You are happily ore-ta'ne.
From my brother?
Yes, from the Lord Ferdinand; your brother,
All loue, and safetie.
Thou do'st blanch mischiefe
Wouldst make
it
white: See, see;
like
the calme weather
At Sea, before a tempest, false hearts speake faire
To
those they intend most mischiefe.
A Letter.
Send Antonio
to
me; I want his head
in
a busines:
(a politicke equiuocation)
He doth not want your councell, but your head;
That
is, he cannot sleepe till you be dead.
And here is another Pitfall,
that
is strew'd ore
With Roses: marke
it
,
it
is a cunning one.
I stand ingaged
for
your husband,
for
seuerall debts at Naples: let not
That
trouble him, I had rather have his heart, than his mony.
And I beleeue
so
too.
What do you beleeue?
That
he
so
much distrusts my husbands loue,
He
will
by
no
meanes beleeue his heart is with him
Vntill he see
it
: The Diuell is not cunning enough
To
circumuent
us
in
Ridles.
Will
you reiect
that
noble, and free league
Of amitie, and loue
which
I present you?
Their league is
like
that
of some politick Kings
Onely
to
make themselues of strength, and powre
To
be
our
after-ruine: tell them
so
;
And what from you?
Thus tell him: I
will
not come.
And what of this.
My brothers have dispers'd
Blood-hounds abroad;
which
till I heare are muzell'd
No
truce, though hatch'd with nere such politick skill
Is safe,
that
hangs
upon
our
enemies
will
.
I
will
not come at them.
This proclaimes your breeding.
Euery finall thing, drawes a base mind
to
feare;
As the Adamant drawes yron: fare you well sir,
You shall shortly eare from
us
.
Exit.
I suspect some Ambush:
Therefore
by
all my loue; I do coniure you
To
take your eldest sonne, and flye towards Millaine;
Let
us
not venture all this poore remainder
In
one vnlucky bottom.
You councell safely:
Best of my life, farewell: Since
we
must part
Heauen hath a hand
in
it
: but
no
otherwise,
Then as some curious Artist, takes
in
sunder
A Clocke, or Watch, when
it
is out of frame
To
bring
it
in
better order.
I know not
which
is best,
To
see you dead, or part with you: Farewell Boy,
Thou art happy,
that
thou hast not vnderstanding
To
know thy misery:
For
all
our
wit
And reading, brings
us
to
a truer sence
Of sorrow:
In
the eternall Church, Sir,
I do hope
we
shall not part thus.
O, be of comfort,
Make Patience a noble fortitude:
And thinke not how vnkindly
we
are vs'de:
Man (
like
to
Cassia) is prou'd best, being bruiz'd.
Must I
like
to
a slaue-borne Russian,
Account
it
praise
to
suffer tyranny?
And yet (O Heauen) thy heauy hand is
in
it
.
I have seene my little boy, oft scourge his top,
And compar'd my selfe
to
it
: naught made me ere go right,
But Heauens scourge-sticke.
Do not weepe:
Heauen fashion'd
us
of nothing; and
we
striue,
To
bring our selues
to
nothing: farewell Cariola,
And thy sweet armefull; if I do neuer see thee more,
Be a good Mother
to
your litle ones,
And saue them from the Tiger: fare you well.
Let me looke
upon
you once more:
for
that
speech
Came from a dying father: your kisse is colder
Then
that
I have seene an holy Anchorite
Giue
to
a dead mans skull.
My heart is turnde
to
a heauy lumpe of lead
With
which
I found my danger: fare you well.
Exit.
My Laurell is all withered.
Looke (Madam) what a troope of armed men
Make towards
us
.
Enter Bosola with a Guard.
O, they are very welcome:
When Fortunes, wheele, is ouer-charg'd with Princes,
The waight makes
it
moue swift. I would have my ruine
Be sudden: I am your aduenture, am I not.
You are, you must see your husband
no
more,
What Diuell art thou,
that
counterfeits heauens thunder?
Is
that
terrible? I would have you tell me
Whether is
that
note worse,
that
frights the silly birds
Out of the corne or
that
which
doth allure them
To
the nets? you have hearkned
to
the last too much.
O misery:
like
to
a rusty ore-char'd Cannon,
Shall I neuer flye
in
peeces? come:
to
what Prison?
To
none.
Whether then?
To
your Pallace.
I have heard
that
Charons boate, serues
to
conuay
All ore the dismall Lake, but brings none backe againe.
Your brothers meane you, safety, and pitie.
Pitie? with such a pitie men preserue aliue
Pheasants, and Quailes, when they are not fat enough
To
be eaten.
These are your children?
Yes:
Can they pratle?
No
:
But I intend, since they were borne accurs'd;
Cursses shall be their first language.
Fye (Madam)
Forget this base, low-fellow.
Were I a man:
I would beat
that
counterfeit face, into thy other
One of
no
Birth.
Say
that
he was borne meane.
Man is most happy, when his owne actions
Be arguments, and examples of his Vertue.
A barren, beggerly vertue.
I pre-thee
who
is greatest, can you tell?
Sad tales befit my woe: I
will
tell you one.
A Salmon, as she swam vnto the Sea,
Met with a Dog-fish;
who
encounters
her
With this rough language: why art thou
so
bold
To
mixe thy selfe with
our
high state of floods
Being
no
eminent Courtier, but one
That
for
the calmest, and fresh time of the yeere
Do'st liue
in
shallow Riuers, rank'st thy selfe
With silly Smylts, and Shrympes? and darest thou
Passe
by
our
Dog-ship, without reuerence?
O (Quoth the Salmon) sister, be at peace:
Thanke Iupiter,
we
both have pass'd the Net,
Our
value neuer can be truely knowne,
Till
in
the Fishers basket
we
be showne,
In
the Market then my price may be the higher,
Euen when I am neerest
to
the Cooke, and fire.
So
,
to
great men, the Morrall may be stretched.
Men oft are valued high, when they are most wretch'd.
But come: whether you please: I am arm'd 'gainst misery:
Bent
to
all swaies of the Oppressors
will
.
There is
no
deepe Valley, but neere some great Hill.

ACTVS IIII.
SCENA. I.
Ferdinand, Bosola, Dutchesse, Cariola, Seruants.
How doth
our
sister Dutchesse beare her selfe
In
her
imprisonment?
Nobly: I
will
describe
her
:
She is sad, as one long vs'd
to
it
: and she seemes
Rather
to
welcome the end of misery
Then shun
it
: a behauiour
so
noble,
As giues a maiestie
to
aduersitie:
You may discerne the shape of louelinesse.
More perfect,
in
her
teares, then
in
her
smiles;
She
will
muse foure houres together: and
her
silence,
(Me thinkes) expresseth more, then if she spake.
Her
mellancholly seemes
to
be fortifide
With a strange disdaine.
It
is
so
: and this restraint
(
Like
English Mastiffes,
that
grow feirce with tying)
Makes
her
too passionately apprehend
Those pleasures she is kept from.
Curse
upon
her
:
I
will
no
longer study
in
the booke
Of anothers heart: informe
her
what I told you.
Exit.
All comfort
to
your Grace;
I
will
have none:
'Pray-thee,
who
do'st thou wrap thy poysond Pilles
In
Gold, and Sugar?
Your elder brother the Lord Ferdinand
Is come
to
visite you: and sends you word
'Cause once he rashly made a solemne vowe
Neuer
to
see you more; he comes
in
the night:
And prayes you (gently) neither Torch, nor Taper
Shine
in
your Chamber: he
will
kisse your hand:
And reconcile himselfe: but,
for
his vowe,
He dares not see you:
At his pleasure:
Take hence the lights: he has come.
Where are you?
Here sir:
This darkenes suites you well.
I would aske you pardon:
You have
it
;
For
I account
it
, the honorabl'st reuenge
Where I may kill,
to
pardon: where are your Cubbs?
Whom?
Call them your children;
For
though
our
nationall law, distinguish Bastards
From true legitimate issue: compassionate nature
Makes them all equall.
Do you visit me
for
this?
You violate a Sacrament of the Church
Shall make you howle
in
the hell
for
it
.
It
had been well,
Could you have liu'd thus alwayes:
for
indeed
You were too much
in
the light: But
no
more,
I come
to
seale my peace with you: here is a hand,
giues
her
a dead mans hand.
To
which
you have vow'd much loue: the Ring
upon
it
You gaue.
I affectionately kisse
it
:
'Pray do: and bury the print of
it
in
your heart:
I
will
leaue this Ring with you,
for
a Loue-token:
And the hand, as sure as the ring: and do not doubt
But you shall have the heart too: when you need a friend
Send
it
to
him,
that
ow'de
it
: you shall see
Whether he can ayd you.
You are very cold.
I feare you are not well after your trauell:
Hah? lights: o horrible:
Let
her
have lights enough
Exit.
What witch-craft doth he practise,
that
he hath left
A dead-mans hand here? --
Here is discouer'd, (behind a Trauers;) the artificiall figures of Antonio, and his children; appearing as if they were dead.
Looke you: here is the peece, from
which
it
was ta'ne;
He doth present you this sad spectacle,
That
now you know directly they are dead,
Here after you may (wisely) cease
to
grieue
For
that
which
cannot be recouered.
There is not betweene heauen, and earth one wish
I stay
for
after this:
it
wastes me more,
Then were
it
my picture, fashion'd out of wax,
Strucke with a magicall needle, and then burned
In
some fowle dung-hill: and yond is an excellent property
For
a tyrant,
which
I would account mercy,
What is
that
?
If they would bring me
to
that
liueles truncke,
And let me freeze
to
death.
Come, you must liue.
That
is the greatest torture soules feele
in
hell,
In
hell:
that
they must liue, and cannot die:
Portia, I
will
new kindle thy Coales againe,
And reuiue the rare, and almost dead example
Of a louing wife.
O fye: despaire? remember
You are a Christian.
The Church enioynes fasting:
I
will
starue my selfe
to
death.
Leaue this vaine sorrow;
Things being at the worst, begin
to
mend:
The Bee when he hath shot his sting into your hand
May then play with your eye-lyd.
Good comfortable fellow
Perswade a wretch
that
is broke
upon
the wheele
To
have all his bones new set: entreate him liue,
To
be executed againe:
who
must dispatch me?
I account this world a tedious Theatre,
For
I do play a part
in
it
'gainst my
will
.
Come, be of comfort, I
will
saue your life.
Indeed I have not leysure
to
tend
so
small a busines,
Now,
by
my life, I pitty you.
Thou art a foole then,
To
wast thy pitty
on
a thing
so
wretch'd
As cannot pitty
it
: I am full of daggers:
Puffe: let me blow these vipers from me.
What are you?
One
that
wishes you long life.
I would thou wert hang'd
for
the horrible curse
Thou hast giuen me: I shall shortly grow one
Of the miracles of pitty: I
will
goe pray:
No
,
I
will
goe curse:
O fye:
I could curse the Starres.
O fearefull:
And those three smyling seasons of the yeere
Into a Russian winter: nay the world
To
its first Chaos.
Looke you, the Starres shine still:
O, but you must remember, my curse hath a great way
to
goe:
Plagues, (
that
make lanes through largest families)
Consume them:
Fye Lady:
Let them
like
tyrants
Neuer be remembred, but
for
the ill they have done:
Let all the zealous prayers of mortefied
Church-men forget them,
O vncharitable:
Let heauen, a little while, cease crowning Martirs
To
punish them: Goe, howle them this: and say I long
to
bleed
It
is some mercy, when men kill with speed.
Exit.
Excellent; as I would wish: she is plagu'd
in
Art.
These presentations are but fram'd
in
wax.
By
the curious Master
in
that
Qualitie,
Vincentio Lauriola, and she takes them
For
true substantiall Bodies.
Why do you do this?
To
bring
her
to
despaire.
'Faith, end here:
And go
no
farther
in
your cruelty,
Send
her
a penetentiall garment,
to
put
on
,
Next
to
her
delicate skinne, and furnish
her
With beades, and prayer bookes.
Damne
her
,
that
body of hers,
While
that
my blood ran pure
in
it
, was more worth
Then,
that
which
thou wouldst comfort, (call'd a soule)
I
will
send
her
masques of common Curtizans,
Have
her
meate seru'd
up
by
baudes, and ruffians,
And ('cause she
will
needes be mad) I am resolu'd
To
remoue forth the common Hospitall,
All the mad-folke, and place them neere
her
lodging:
There let them practise together, sing, and daunce,
And act their gambols
to
the full of the moone:
If she can sleepe the better
for
it
, let
her
,
Your worke is almost ended.
Must I see
her
againe?
Yes.
Neuer.
You must.
Neuer
in
mine owne shape,
That
is forfeited,
by
my intelligence,
And this last cruell lie: when you send me next,
The businesse shall be comfort.
Very likely,
Thy pity is nothing of kin
to
thee: Antonio,
Lurkes about Millaine, thou shalt shortly thither,
To
feede a fire, as great as my reuenge,
Which
neuer
will
slacke, till
it
have spent his fuell,
Intemperate ague, make Physitians cruell.
Exeunt.
SCENA II.
Duchesse, Cariola, Seruants, Mad-men, Bosola, Executioners, Ferdinand.
What hideous noyse was
that
?
It
is the wild consort
Of Mad-men (Lady)
which
your Tyrant brother
Hath plac'd about your lodging: This tyranny,
I thinke was neuer practis'd till this howre.
Indeed I thanke him: nothing but noyce, and folly
Can keepe me
in
my right wits, whereas reason
And silence, make me starke mad: Sit downe,
Discourse
to
me some dismall Tragedy.
O
it
will
encrease your mellancholly.
Thou art deceiu'd,
To
heare of greater griefe, would lessen mine,
This is a prison?
Yes, but you shall liue
To
shake this durance off.
Thou art a foole,
The Robin red-brest, and the Nightingale,
Neuer liue long
in
cages.
Pray drie your eyes.
What thinke you of Madam?
Of nothing:
When I muse thus, I sleepe.
Like
a mad-man, with your eyes open?
Do'st thou thinke
we
shall know one an other,
In
the other world?
Yes, out of question.
O
that
it
were possible
we
might
But hold some two dayes conference with the dead,
From them, I should learne somewhat, I am sure
I neuer shall know here: I
will
tell thee a miracle,
I am not mad yet,
to
my cause of sorrow.
The heauen ore my head seemes made of molton brasse,
The earth of flaming sulphure, yet I am not mad:
I am acquainted with sad misery,
As the tan'd galley-slaue is with his Oare,
Necessity makes me suffer constantly,
And custome makes
it
easie,
who
do I looke
like
now?
Like
to
your picture
in
the gallery,
A deale of life
in
shew, but none
in
practise:
Or rather
like
some reuerend monument,
Whose ruines, are euen pittied.
Very proper:
And Fortune seemes onely
to
have
her
eie-sight,
To
behold my Tragedy: How now,
What noyce is
that
?
I am come
to
tell you,
Your brother hath entended you some sport:
A great Physitian, when the Pope was sicke
Of a deepe mellancholly, presented him
With seuerall sorts of mad-men,
which
wilde obiect
(Being full of change and sport,) forc'd him
to
laugh,
And
so
the impost-hume broke: the selfe same cure,
The Duke intends
on
you.
Let them come
in
.
There is a mad Lawyer, and a secular Priest,
A Doctor
that
hath forfeited his wits
By
iealousie: an Astrologian,
That
in
his workes, sayd such a day of the moneth,
Should be the day of doome; and fayling of
it
,
Ran mad: an English Taylor, crais'd
in
the braine,
With the studdy of new fashion: a gentleman vsher
Quite beside himselfe, with care
to
keepe
in
minde,
The number of his Ladies salutations;
Or how do you, she employ'd him
in
each morning:
A Farmer too, (an excellent knaue
in
graine)
Mad, 'cause he was hindred transportation,
And let one Broaker, (
that
is mad) loose
to
these,
You would thinke the diuell were among them.
Sit Cariola: let them loose when you please,
For
I am chain'd
to
endure all your tyranny.
Here (
by
a Mad-man) this song is sung,
to
a dismall kind of Musique.
O let
us
howle, some heauy note,
some deadly-dogged howle,
Sounding, as from the threatning throat,
of beastes, and fatall fowle.
As Rauens, Schrich-owles, Bulls, and Beares,
we
will
bill, and bawle
our
parts,
Till yerk-some noyce have cloy'd your eares,
and corasiu'd your hearts.
At last when as
our
quire wants breath,
our
bodies being blest,
We
will
sing
like
Swans,
to
welcome death,
and die
in
loue and rest.
Doomes-day not come yet? I
will
draw
it
neerer
by
perspectiue, or
to
make a glasse,
that
shall set all the world
on
fire
upon
an instant: I cannot sleepe, my pillow is stuff't with a littour of Porcupines.
Hell is a meere glasse-house, where the diuells are continually blowing
up
womens soules,
on
hollow yrons, and the fire neuer goes out.
I
will
lie with euery woman
in
my parish the tenth night:
I
will
tithe them ouer,
like
hay-cockes.
Shall my Pothecary out-go me, because I am a
Cuck-old? I have found out his roguery: he makes allom
Of his wiues vrin, and sells
it
to
Puritaines,
that
have sore
Throates with ouer-strayning.
I have skill
in
Harroldry.
Hast?
You do giue
for
your creast, a wood-cockes head, with the
Braines pickt out of
it
, you are a very ancient Gentleman.
Greeke is turn'd Turke,
we
are only
to
be sau'd
by
the
Heluetian translation.
Come
on
Sir, I
will
lay the law
to
you.
Oh, rather lay a coraziue, the law
will
eate
to
the bone.
He
that
drinkes but
to
satisfie nature is damn'd.
If I had my glasse here, I would shew a sight should make
All the women here, call me mad Doctor.
What is he, a rope-maker?
No
,
no
,
no
, a snufling knaue,
that
while he shewes the
Tombes,
will
have his hand
in
a wenches placket.
Woe,
to
the Caroach,
that
brought home my wife from
The Masque, at three a clocke
in
the morning,
it
had a large
Feather-bed
in
it
.
I have paired the diuells nayles forty times, roasted them
In
Rauens egges, and cur'd agues with them.
Get me three hundred milch bats,
to
make possets,
To
procure sleepe.
All the Colledge may throw their caps at me, I have made a
Soape-boyler costiue,
it
was my master-peece: --
Here the Daunce consisting of 8 Mad-men, with musicke answerable there-unto, after
which
, Bosola (
like
an old man) enters.
Is he mad too?
'Pray question him: I
will
leaue you.
I am come
to
make thy tombe.
Hah, my tombe?
Thou speak'st, as if I lay
upon
my death bed,
Gasping
for
breath: do'st thou perceiue me sicke?
Yes, and the more dangerously, since thy sicknesse is insensible.
Thou art not mad sure, do'st know me?
Yes.
Who
am I?
Thou art a box of worme-seede, at best, but a saluatory Of greene mummey: what is this flesh? a little cruded milke, Phantasticall puffe-paste:
our
bodies are weaker then those Paper prisons boyes vse
to
keep flies
in
: more contemptible: Since
ours
is
to
preserue earth-wormes: didst thou euer see A Larke
in
a cage? such is the soule
in
the body: this world Is
like
her
little turfe of grasse, and the Heauen ore
our
heades,
Like
her
looking glasse, ouerly giues
us
a miserable knowledge Of the small compasse of
our
prison.
Am not I, thy Duchesse?
Thou art some great woman sure,
for
riot begins
to
sit
on
thy Fore-head (clad
in
gray haires) twenty yeares sooner, then
on
a Merry milkemaydes. Thou sleep'st worse, then if a mouse Should be forc'd
to
take
up
her
lodging
in
a cats eare: A little infant,
that
breedes its teeth, should
it
lie with thee, would Crie out, as if thou wert the more vnquiet bed-fellow.
I am Duchesse of Malfy still.
That
makes thy sleepes
so
broken:
Glories (
like
glowe-wormes) a farre off, shine bright,
But look'd
to
neere, have neither heate, nor light.
Thou art very plaine.
My trade is
to
flatter the dead, not the liuing
I am a tombe-maker.
And thou com'st
to
make my tombe?
Yes.
Let me be a little merry,
Of what stuffe wilt thou make
it
?
Nay, resolue me first, of what fashion?
Why, do
we
grow phantasticall
in
our
death-bed?
Do
we
affect fashion
in
the graue?
Most ambitiously: Princes images
on
their tombes,
Do not lie, as they were wont, seeming
to
pray,
Up
to
heauen: but with their hands vnder their cheekes,
(As if they died of the tooth-ache) they are not carued
With their eies, fix'd
upon
the starres; but as their
Mindes were wholy bent
upon
the world,
The self-same way they seeme
to
turne their faces.
Let me know fully therefore the effect
Of this thy dismall preparation,
This talke, fit
for
a charnell?
Now, I shall,
A Coffin, Cords, and a Bell.
Here is a present from your Princely brothers,
And may
it
arriue wel-come,
for
it
brings
Last benefit, last sorrow.
Let me see
it
,
I have
so
much obedience,
in
my blood,
I wish
it
in
their veines,
to
do them good.
This is your last presence Chamber.
O my sweete Lady.
Peace,
it
affrights not me.
I am the common Bell-man,
That
vsually is sent
to
condemn'd persons
The night before they suffer:
Euen now thou said'st,
Thou wast a tombe-maker?
It
was
to
bring you
By
degrees
to
mortification: Listen.
Hearke, now euery thing is still,
The Schritch-Owle, and the whistler shrill,
Call
upon
our
Dame, aloud,
And bid
her
quickly don
her
shrowd:
Much you had of Land and rent,
Your length
in
clay is now competent.
A long war, disturb'd your minde,
Here your perfect peace is sign'd,
Of what is
it
, fooles make such vaine keeping?
Sin their conception, their birth, weeping:
Their life, a generall mist of error,
Their death, a hideous storme of terror,
Strew your haire, with powders sweete:
D'on cleane linnen, bath your feete,
And the foule feend more
to
checke)
A crucifixe let blesse your necke,
It
is now full tide, 'tweene night and day,
End your groane, and come away.
Hence villaines, tyrants, murderers: alas!
What
will
you do with my Lady? call
for
helpe.
To
whom,
to
our
next neighbours? they are mad-folkes.
Remooue
that
noyse.
Farwell Cariola,
In
my last
will
, I have not much
to
giue
A many hungry guests, have fed
upon
me,
Thine
will
be a poore reuersion.
I
will
die with
her
.
I pray-thee looke thou giu'st my little boy
Some sirrop,
for
his cold, and let the girle
Say
her
prayers, ere she sleepe. Now what you please,
What death?
Strangling, here are your Executioners.
I forgiue them:
The apoplexie, cathar, or cough of the loongs,
Would do as much as they do.
Doth not death fright you?
Who
would be afraid of
it
?
Knowing
to
meete such excellent company
In
the other world.
Yet, me thinkes,
The manner of your death should much afflict you,
This cord should terrifie you?
Not a whit,
What would
it
pleasure me,
to
have my throate cut
With diamonds? or
to
be smothered
With Cassia? or
to
be shot
to
death, with pearles?
I know death hath ten thousand seuerall doores
For
men,
to
take their Exits: and
it
is found
They go
on
such strange geometricall hinges,
You may open them both wayes: any way, (
for
heauen sake)
So
I were out of your whispering: Tell my brothers,
That
I perceiue death, (now I am well a wake)
Best guift is, they can giue, or I can take,
I would faine put off my last womans-fault,
I'l'd not be tedious
to
you.
We
are ready.
Dispose my breath, how please you but my body
Bestow
upon
my women,
will
you?
Yes.
Pull, and pull strongly,
for
your able strength,
Must pull downe heauen
upon
me:
Yet stay, heauen gates are not
so
highly arch'd
As Princes pallaces, they
that
enter there
Must go
upon
their knees: Come violent death,
Serue
for
Mandragora,
to
make me sleepe;
Go tell my brothers, when I am laid out,
They then may feede
in
quiet.
They strangle
her
.
Where is the waiting woman?
Fetch
her
: Some other strangle the children:
Looke you, there sleepes your mistris.
O you are damn'd
Perpetually
for
this: My turne is next,
Is
it
not
so
ordered?
Yes, and I am glad
You are
so
well prepar'd
for
it
.
You are deceiu'd Sir,
I am not prepar'd
for
it
, I
will
not die,
I
will
first come
to
my answere; and know
How I have offended.
Come, dispatch
her
:
You kept
her
counsell, now you shall keepe
ours
.
I
will
not die, I must not, I am contracted
To
a young Gentle-man.
Here is your wedding Ring.
Let me but speake with the Duke: I
will
discouer
Treason
to
his person.
Delayes: throttle
her
.
She bites: and scratches:
If you kill me now
I am damn'd: I have not been at Confession
This two yeeres:
When.
I am quicke with child.
Why then,
Your credit is sau'd: beare
her
in
to
the next roome:
Let this lie still.
Is she dead?
She is what
You would have
her
: But here begin your pitty,
Shewes the children strangled.
Alas, how have these offended?
The death
Of young Wolffes, is neuer
to
be pittied.
Fix your eye here:
Constantly.
Do you not weepe?
Other sinnes, onely speake; Murther shreikes out:
The Element of water, moistens the Earth,
But blood flies upwards, and bedewes the Heauens.
Couer
her
face: Mine eyes dazell; she di'd yong.
I thinke not
so
:
her
infelicitie
Seem'd
to
have yeeres too many.
She, and I were Twinnes:
And should I die this instant, I had liu'd
Her
Time
to
a Mynute.
It
seemes she was borne first:
You have bloodely approu'd the auncient truth,
That
kindred commonly do worse agree
Then remote strangers.
Let me see
her
face againe;
Why didst not thou pitty
her
: what an excellent
Honest man, might'st thou have been
If thou hadst borne
her
to
some Sanctuary?
Or (bold
in
a good cause) oppos'd thy selfe
With thy aduanced sword aboue thy head,
Betweene
her
Innocence, and my Reuenge?
I bad thee, when I was distracted of my wits,
Goe kill my dearest friend, and thou hast don
it
.
For
let me but examine well the cause;
What was the meanenes of
her
match
to
me?
Onely I must confesse, I had a hope
(Had she continu'd widow)
to
have gain'd
An infinite masse of Treasure
by
her
death:
And
that
was the mayne cause;
her
Marriage,
That
drew a streame of gall, quite through my heart;
For
thee, (as
we
obserue
in
Tragedies
That
a good Actor many times is curss'd
For
playing a villaines part) I hate thee
for
it
:
And (
for
my sake) say thou hast done much ill, well:
Let me quicken your memory;
for
I perceiue
You are falling into ingratitude: I challenge
The reward due
to
my seruice.
I
will
tell thee,
What I
will
giue thee,
Do:
I
will
giue thee a pardon
For
this murther:
Hah?
Yes: and
it
is
The largest bounty I can studie
to
do thee.
By
what authority did'st thou execute
This bloody sentence?
By
yours
Mine? was I
her
Iudge?
Did any ceremoniall forme of Law,
Doombe
her
to
not-Being? did a compleat Iury
Deliuer
her
conviction
up
in
the Court?
Where shalt thou find this Iudgement registerd
Vnlesse
in
hell? See:
like
a bloody foole
Thou hast forfeyted thy life, and thou shalt die
for
it
.
The Office of Iustice is peruerted quite
When one Thiefe hangs another:
who
shall dare
To
reueale this:
O, I
will
tell thee:
The Wolfe shall finde
her
Graue, and scrap:
it
up
:
Not
to
deuoure the corpes, but
to
discouer
The horrid murther.
You; not I shall quake
for
it
.
Leaue me:
I
will
first receiue my Pention.
You are a villaine:
When your Ingratitude
Is Iudge, I am
so
;
O horror!
That
not the feare of him,
which
bindes the diuels
Can prescribe man obedience.
Neuer looke
upon
me more.
Why fare thee well:
Your brother, and your selfe, are worthy men;
You have a paire of hearts, are hollow Graues,
Rotten, and rotting others: and your vengeance,
(
Like
two-chain'd bullets) still goes arme
in
arme,
You may be Brothers:
for
treason,
like
the plague,
Doth take much
in
a blood: I stand
like
one
That
long hath ta'ne a sweet, and golden dreame.
I am angry with my selfe, now
that
I wake.
Get thee into some vnknowne part of the world
That
I may neuer see thee.
Let me know
Wherefore I should be thus neglected? sir,
I seru'd your tyranny: and rather stroue,
To
satisfie your selfe, then all the world;
And though I loath'd the euill, yet I lou'd
You
that
did councell
it
: and rather sought
To
appeare a true seruant, then an honest man.
I
will
goe hunt the Badger,
by
Owle-light:
It
is a deed of darkenesse.
Exit.
He is much distracted: Off my painted honour,
While with valne hopes,
our
faculties
we
tyre,
We
seeme
to
sweate
in
yce, and freeze
in
fire;
What would I do, were this
to
do againe?
I would not change my peace of conscience
For
all the wealth of Europe: She stirres; here is life:
Returne (faire soule) from the darkenes, and lead mine
Out of this sencible Hell: She is warme, she breathes:
Upon
thy pale lips I
will
melt my heart
To
store them with fresh colour:
who
is there?
Some cordiall drinke: Alas! I dare not call:
So
pitty, would destroy pitty:
her
Eye opes,
And heauen
in
it
, seemes
to
ope, (
that
late was shut)
To
take me
up
to
mercy.
Antonio.
Yes (Madam) he is liuing,
The dead bodies you saw, were but faign'd statues;
He is reconcil'd
to
your brothers: the Pope hath wrought
The attonement.
Mercy.
she dies,
O, she is gone againe: there the cords of life broake:
O sacred Innocence,
that
sweetely sleepes
On
Turtles feathers: whil'st a guilty conscience
Is a blacke Register, wherein is writ
All
our
good deedes, and bad: a Perspectiue
That
showes
us
hell;
that
we
cannot be suffer'd
To
do good when
we
have a mind
to
it
?
This is manly sorrow:
These teares, I am very certaine, neuer grew
In
my Mothers Milke. My estate is suncke
Below the degree of feare: where were
These penitent fountaines, while she was liuing?
O, they were frozen
up
: here is a sight
As direfull
to
my soule, as is the sword
Vnto a wretch hath slaine his father: Come, I
will
beare thee hence.
And execute thy last
will
;
that
is deliuer
Thy body
to
the reuerent dispose
Of some good women:
that
the cruell tyrant
Shall not denie me: Then I
will
poast
to
Millaine,
Where somewhat I
will
speedily enact
Worth my deiection.
Exit.
ACTVS V.
SCENA. I
Antonio, Delio, Pescara, Iulia.
What thinke you of my hope of reconcilement
To
the Aragonian brethren?
I misdoubt
it
For
though they have sent their letters of safe conduct
For
your repaire
to
Millaine, they appeare
But Nets,
to
entrap you: The Marquis of Pescara,
Vnder whom you hold certaine land
in
Cheit,
Must 'gainst his noble nature, hath been mou'd
To
ceize those lands, and some of his dependants
Are at this instant, making
it
their suit
To
be inuested
in
your Reuenewes.
I cannot thinke, they meane well
to
your life,
That
do depriue you of your meanes of life,
Your liuing.
You are still an heretique.
To
any safety, I can shape my selfe.
Here comes the Marquis: I
will
make my selfe
Petitioner
for
some part of your land,
To
know whether
it
is flying.
I pray do.
Sir, I have a suit
to
you.
To
me.
An easie one:
There is the Cittadell of St Bennet,
With some demeasnes, of late
in
the possession
Of Antonio Bologna, please you bestow them
on
me?
You are my friend: But this is such a suit,
Not fit
for
me
to
giue, nor you
to
take.
No
sir?
I
will
giue you ample reason
for
it
,
Soone
in
priuate: Here is the Cardinalls Mistris.
My Lord, I am growne your poore Petitioner,
And should be an ill begger, had I not
A Great mans letter, here (the Cardinalls)
To
Court you
in
my fauour.
He entreates
for
you
The Cittadell of Saint Bennet,
that
belong'd
To
the banish'd Bologna.
Yes:
I could not have thought of a friend, I could
Rather pleasure with
it
:
it
is yours:
Sir, I thanke you:
And he shall know how doubly I am engag'd
Both
in
your guift, and speedinesse of giuing,
Which
makes your graunt, the greater.
Exit.
How they fortefie
Themselues with my ruine?
Sir: I am
Litle bound
to
you:
Why.
Because you denide this suit,
to
me, and gau
it
To
such a creature.
Do you know what
it
was?
It
was Antonios land: not forfeyted
By
course of lawe; but rauish'd from his throate
By
the Cardinals entreaty:
it
were not fit
I should bestow
so
maine a peece of wrong
Upon
my friend:
it
is a gratification
Onely due
to
a Strumpet:
for
it
is iniustice;
Shall I sprinckle the pure blood of Innocents
To
make those followers, I call my friends
Looke ruddier
upon
me? I am glad
This land, (ta'ne from the owner
by
such wrong)
Returnes againe vnto
so
fowle an vse,
As Salary
for
his Lust. Learne, (good Delio)
To
aske noble things of me, and you shall find
I
will
be a noble giuer.
You instruct me well:
Why, here is a man, now, would fright impudence
From sawciest Beggers.
Prince Ferdinand's come
to
Millaine
Sicke (as they giue out) of an Appoplexie:
But some say,
it
is a frenzie; I am going
To
visite him.
Exit.
It
is a noble old fellow:
What course do you meane
to
take, Antonio?
This night, I meane
to
venture all my fortune
(
Which
is
no
more, then a poore lingring life)
To
the Cardinals worst of mallice: I have got
Priuate accesse
to
his chamber: and intend
To
visit him, about the mid of night.
(As once his brother did
our
noble Dutchesse.)
It
may be
that
the sudden apprehension
Of danger (
for
I
will
goe
in
mine owne shape)
When he shall see
it
fraight with loue, and dutie,
May draw the poyson out of him, and worke
A friendly reconcilement; if
it
faile;
Yet,
it
shall rid me of this infamous calling,
For
better fall once, then be euer falling.
I
will
second you
in
all danger: and (how ere)
My life keepes rancke with yours
You are still my lou'd and best friend.
Exeunt.
SCENA. II.
Pescara, a Doctor, Ferdinand, Cardinall, Malateste, Bosola, Iulia.
Now Doctor; may I visit your Patient?
If
it
please your Lordship: but he is instantly
To
take the ayre here
in
the Gallery,
By
my direction.
'Pray-thee, what is his disease?
A very pestilent disease (my Lord)
They call Lucanthropia.
What is
that
?
I need a Dictionary
to
it
.
I
will
tell you:
In
those
that
are possess'd with
it
there ore-flowes
Such mellencholy humour, they imagine
Themselues
to
be transformed into Woolues,
Steale forth
to
Church-yards
in
the dead of night,
And dig dead bodies
up
: as two nights since
One met the Duke, 'bout midnight
in
a lane
Behind St Markes Church, with the leg of a man
Upon
his shoulder; and he howl'd fearefully:
Said he was a Woolffe: onely the difference
Was, a Woolffes skinne was hairy
on
the out-side,
His
on
the In-side: bad them take their swords,
Rip
up
his flesh, and trie: straight I was sent
for
,
And hauing ministerd
to
him, found his Grace
Very well recouered.
I am glad of
it
.
Yet not without some feare
Of a relaps: if he grow
to
his fit againe
I
will
goe a neerer way
to
worke with him
Then euer Paraclesus dream'd of: If
They
will
giue me leaue I
will
buffet his madnesse out of him.
Stand aside: he comes.
Leaue me.
Why doth your Lordship loue this solitarines?
Eagles commonly fly alone: They are Crowes, Dawes, and
Sterlings
that
flocke together: Looke, what is
that
,
Followes me?
Nothing (my Lord)
Yes:
It
is your shadow.
Stay
it
, let
it
not haunt me.
Impossible; if you moue, and the Sunshine:
I
will
throtle
it
.
O, my Lord: you are angry with nothing.
You are a foole:
How is
it
possible I should catch my shadow
Vnlesse I fall
upon
it
? When I goe
to
Hell,
I meane
to
carry a bribe:
for
looke you
Good guifts euer-more make way,
for
the worst persons.
Rise good my Lord.
I am studying the Art of Patience.
It
is a noble Vertue;
To
driue six Snailes before me, from this towne
To
Mosco; neither vse Goad, nor Whip
to
them,
But let them take their owne time: (the patientst man
in
the world
Match me
for
an experiment) and I
will
crawle after
Like
a sheepe-biter.
Force him
up
.
Vse me well, you were best:
What I have don, I have don: I
will
confesse nothing
Now let me come
to
him: Are you mad
(My Lord?) are you out of your Princely wits?
What is he?
Your Doctor.
Let me have his beard saw'd off, and his eye
Browes fil'd more ciuill.
I must do mad trickes with him,
For
that
is the onely way of
it
. I have brought
Your grace a Salamanders skin,
to
keepe you
From sun-burning.
I have cruell sore eyes.
The white of a Cockatrixes-egge is present remedy.
Let
it
be a new layd one, you were best:
Hide me from him: Phisitians are
like
Kings,
They brooke
no
contradiction.
Now he begins
to
feare me,
Now let me alone with him.
How now, put off your gowne?
Let me have some forty vrinalls fill'd with Rose-water:
He, and I
will
go pelt one an other with them,
Now he begins
to
feare me: Can you fetch a friske, sir?
Let him go, let him go
upon
my perrill:
I finde
by
his eye, he stands
in
awe of me,
I
will
make him, as tame as a Dormouse.
Can you fetch your friskes, sir: I
will
stamp him into a Gullice:
Flea off his skin,
to
couer one of the Anotomies,
This rogue hath set
in
the cold yonder,
in
Barber-Chyrurgeons hall:
Hence, hence, you are all of you,
like
beasts
for
sacrifice,
There is nothing left of you, but tongue, and belly,
Flattery, and leachery.
Doctor, he did not feare you throughly.
True, I was somewhat too forward.
Mercy
upon
me, what a fatall iudgement
Hath falne
upon
this Ferdinand?
Knowes your grace
What accident hath brought vnto the Prince,
This strange distraction?
I must faigne somewhat: Thus they say
it
grew,
You have heard
it
rumor'd
for
these many yeares,
None of
our
family dies, but there is seene
The shape of an old woman,
which
is giuen
By
tradition,
to
us
,
to
have been murther'd
By
her
Nephewes,
for
her
riches. Such a figure
One night (as the Prince sat
up
late at his booke)
Appear'd
to
him, when crying out
for
helpe,
The gentlemen of his chamber, found his grace
All
on
a cold sweate, alter'd much
in
face
And language: Since
which
apparition,
He hath growne worse, and worse, and I much feare
He cannot liue.
Sir, I would speake with you.
We
will
leaue your grace,
Wishing
to
the sicke Prince,
our
noble Lord,
All health of minde, and body.
You are most welcome:
Are you come?
so
: this fellow must not know
By
any meanes I had intelligence
In
our
Duchesse death:
For
(though I counsell'd
it
,)
The full of all the ingagement seem'd
to
grow
From Ferdinand: Now sir, how fares
our
sister?
I do not thinke but sorrow makes
her
looke
Like
to
an oft-di'd garment: She shall now
Tast comfort from me: why do you looke
so
wildely?
O, the fortune of your master here, the Prince
Deiects you, but be you of happy comfort:
If you
will
do one thing
for
me, I
will
entreate
Though he had a cold tombe-stone ore his bones,
I would make you what you would be.
Any thing,
Giue
it
me
in
a breath, and let me flie
to
it
:
They
that
thinke long, small expedition win,
For
musing much
on
the end, cannot begin.
Sir,
will
you come
in
to
Supper?
I am busie, leaue me.
What an excellent shape hath
that
fellow?
Exit Card.
It
is thus: Antonio lurkes here
in
Millaine,
Enquire him out, and kill him: while he liues,
Our
sister cannot marry, and I have thought
Of an excellent match
for
her
: do this, and stile me
Thy aduancement.
But
by
what meanes shall I find him out?
There is a gentleman, call'd Delio
Here
in
the Campe,
that
hath been long approu'd
His loyall friend: Set eie
upon
that
fellow,
Follow him
to
Masse, may be Antonio.
Although he do account religion
But a Schoole-name,
for
fashion of the world,
May accompany him, or else go enquire out
Delio's Confessor, and see if you can bribe
Him
to
reueale
it
: there are a thousand wayes
A man might find
to
trace him: As
to
know,
What fellowes haunt the Iewes,
for
taking
up
Great summes of money,
for
sure he is
in
want,
Or else
to
go
to
the Picture-makers, and learne
Who
brought
her
Picture lately, some of these
Happily may take --
Well, I
will
not freeze
in
the businesse,
I would see
that
wretched thing, Antonio
Aboue all sightes
in
the world.
Do, and be happy.
Exit.
This fellow doth breed Bazalisques
in
his eies,
He is nothing else, but murder: yet he seemes
Not
to
have notice of the Duchesse death:
It
is his cunning: I must follow his example,
There cannot be a surer way
to
trace,
Then than of an old Fox.
So
, sir, you are well met.
How now?
Nay, the doores are fast enough:
Now Sir, I
will
make you confesse your treachery.
Treachery?
Yes, confesse
to
me
Which
of my women
it
was you hyr'd,
to
put
Loue-powder into my drinke?
Loue powder?
Yes, when I was at Malfy,
Why should I fall
in
loue with such a face else?
I have already suffer'd
for
thee
so
much paine,
The onely remedy
to
do me good,
Is
to
kill my longing.
Sure your Pistoll holds
Nothing but perfumes, or kissing comfits: excellent Lady,
You have a pritty way of
it
to
discouer
Your longing: Come, come, I
will
disarme you,
And arme you thus, yet this is wondrous strange.
Compare thy forme, and my eyes together,
You
will
find my loue
no
such great miracle: Now you
will
say,
I am wanton: This nice modesty,
in
Ladies
Is but a troublesome familiar,
That
haunts them.
Know you me, I am a blunt souldier.
The better,
Sure, there wants fire, where there are
no
liuely sparkes
Of roughnes.
And I want complement.
Why ignorance
in
court-ship cannot make you do amisse,
If you have a heart
to
do well.
You are very faire.
Nay, if you lay beauty
to
my charge,
I must plead vnguilty.
Your bright eyes
Carry a Quiuer of darts
in
them, sharper
Then Sun-beames.
You
will
mar me with commendation,
Put your selfe
to
the charge of courting me,
Whereas now I woe you.
I have
it
, I
will
worke
upon
this Creature,
Let
us
grow most amorously familiar:
If the great Cardinall now should see me thus,
Would he not count me a villaine?
No
, he might count me a wanton,
Not lay a scruple of offence
on
you:
For
if I see, and steale a Diamond,
The fault is not
in
the stone, but
in
me the thiefe,
That
purloines
it
: I am sudaine with you,
We
that
are great women of pleasure, vse
to
cut off
These vncertaine wishes, and vnquiet longings,
And
in
an instant ioyne the sweete delight
And the pritty excuse together: had you been
in
the streete,
Vnder my chamber window, euen there
I should have courted you.
O, you are an excellent Lady.
Bid me do somewhat
for
you presently,
To
expresse I loue you.
I
will
, and if you loue me,
Faile not
to
effect
it
: The Cardinall is growne wondrous mellancholly,
Demand the cause, let him not put you off,
With faign'd excuse, discouer the maine ground of
it
.
Why would you know this?
I have depended
on
him,
And I heare
that
he is falne
in
some disgrace
With the Emperour, if he be,
like
the mice
That
forsake falling houses, I would shift
To
other dependance.
You shall not neede follow the warres,
I
will
be your maintenance.
And I your loyall seruant,
But I cannot leaue my calling.
Not leaue an
Vngratefull Generall,
for
the loue of a sweete Lady?
You are
like
some, cannot sleepe
in
feather-beds,
But must have blockes
for
their pillowes.
Will
you do this?
Cunningly.
To morrow I
will
expect the intelligence.
To morrow? get you into my Cabinet,
You shall have
it
with you: do not delay me,
No
more then I do you: I am
like
one
That
is condemn'd: I have my pardon promis'd.
But I would see
it
seal'd: Go, get you
in
,
You shall see me winde my tongue about his heart,
Like
a skeine of silke.
Where are you?
Here.
Let none
upon
your liues
Have conference with the Prince Ferdinand,
Vnlesse I know
it
:
In
this distraction
He may reueale the murther:
Yond is my lingring consumption:
I am weary of
her
; and
by
any meanes
Would be quit off.
How now, my Lord?
What ailes you?
Nothing.
O, you are much alterd:
Come I must be your Secretary, and remoue
This lead from off your bosome, what is the matter?
I may not tell you.
Are you
so
farre
in
loue with sorrow,
You cannot part, with part of
it
? or thinke you
I cannot loue your grace, when you are sad,
As well as merry? or do you suspect
I,
that
have been a secret
to
your heart,
These many winters, cannot be the same
Vnto your tongue?
Satisfie thy longing,
The onely way
to
make thee keepe my councell,
Is not
to
tell thee.
Tell your eccho this,
Or flatterers,
that
(
like
ecchoes) still report
What they heare (though most imperfect) and not me:
For
, if
that
you be true vnto your selfe,
I
will
know.
Will
you racke me?
No
, iudgement shall
Draw
it
from you:
It
is an equall fault,
To
tell ones secrets, vnto all, or none.
The first argues folly.
But the last tyranny.
Very well, why imagine I have committed
Some secret deed,
which
I desire the world
May neuer heare of?
Therefore may not I know
it
?
You have conceal'd
for
me, as great a sinne
As adultery: Sir, neuer was occasion
For
perfect triall of my constancy
Till now: Sir, I beseech you.
You
will
repent
it
.
Neuer.
It
hurries thee
to
ruine: I
will
not tell thee,
Be well aduis'd, and thinke what danger
it
is
To
receiue a Princes secrets: they
that
do,
Had neede have their breasts hoop'd with adamant
To
containe them: I pray thee yet be satisfi'd,
Examine thine owne frailety,
it
is more easie
To
tie knots, then vnloose them:
it
is a secret
That
(
like
a lingring poyson) may chance lie
Spread
in
thy vaines, and kill thee seauen yeare hence.
Now you dally with me.
No
more, thou shalt know
it
.
By
my appointment, the great Duchesse of Malfy,
And two of
her
yong children, foure nights since
Were strangled.
O heauen! (sir) what have you done?
How now? how setles this? thinke you your
Bosome
will
be a graue, darke and obscure enough
For
such a secret?
You have vndone your selfe (sir.)
Why?
It
lies not
in
me
to
conceale
it
.
No
? come, I
will
sweare you
to
it
upon
this booke.
Most religiously.
Kisse
it
.
Now you shall neuer vtter
it
, thy curiosity
Hath vndone thee: thou art poyson'd with
that
booke,
Because I knew thou couldst not keepe my councell,
I have bound thee
to
it
by
death.
For
pitty sake, hold.
Ha, Bosola!
I forgiue you,
This equall peece of Iustice you have done:
For
I betraid your councell
to
that
fellow,
He ouer heard
it
;
that
was the cause I said
It
lay not
in
me,
to
conceale
it
.
O foolish woman,
Couldst not thou have poyson'd him?
It
is weaknesse,
Too much
to
thinke what should have been done,
I go, I know not whether.
Wherefore com'st thou hither?
That
I might finde a great man, (
like
your selfe,)
Not out of his wits (as the Lord Ferdinand)
To
remember my seruice.
I
will
have thee hew'd
in
peeces.
Make not your selfe such a promise of
that
life
Which
is not yours,
to
dispose of.
Who
plac'd thee here.
Her
lust, as she intended.
Very well, now you know me
for
your fellow murderer.
And wherefore should you lay faire marble colours,
Upon
your rotten purposes
to
me?
Vnlesse you imitate some
that
do plot great Treasons,
And when they have done, go hide themselues
in
the graues,
Of those were Actors
in
it
?
No
more,
There is a fortune attends thee.
Shall I go sue
to
fortune any longer?
It
is the fooles Pilgrimage.
I have honors
in
store
for
thee.
There are many wayes
that
conduct
to
seeming
Honor, and some of them very durty ones.
Throw
to
the diuell
Thy mellancholly, the fire burnes well,
What neede
we
keepe a stirring of
it
, and make
A greater smoother? thou wilt kill Antonio?
Yes.
Take
up
that
body.
I thinke I shall
Shortly grow the common Beare,
for
Church-yards?
I
will
allow thee some dozen of attendants,
To
aide thee
in
the murther.
O,
by
no
meanes,
Phisitians
that
apply horse-leiches
to
any rancke swelling,
Vse
to
cut off their tailes,
that
the blood may run through them
The faster: Let me have
no
traine, when I goe
to
shed blood,
Least
it
make me have a greater, when I ride
to
the Gallowes.
Come
to
me after midnight,
to
helpe
to
remoue
that
body
To
her
owne Lodging: I
will
giue out she dide of the Plague;
It
will
breed the lesse enquiry after
her
death.
Where is Castruchio,
her
husband?
He is rod
to
Naples
to
take possession
Of Antonio's Cittadell.
Beleeue me, you have done a very happy turne.
Faile not
to
come: There is the Master-key
Of
our
Lodgings: and
by
that
you may conceiue
What trust I plant
in
you.
Exit.
You shall find me ready.
O poore Antonio, though nothing be
so
needfull
To
thy estate, as pitty, Yet I finde
Nothing
so
dangerous: I must looke
to
my footing;
In
such slippery yce-pauements, men had neede
To
be frost-nayld well: they may breake their neckes else.
The President is here afore me: how this man
Beares
up
in
blood? seemes feareles? why,
it
is well:
Securitie some men call the Suburbs of Hell,
Onely a dead wall betweene. Well (good Antonio)
I
will
seeke thee out; and all my care shall be
To
put thee into safety from the reach
Of these most cruell biters,
that
have got
Some of thy blood already.
It
may be,
I
will
ioyne with thee,
in
a most iust reuenge.
The weakest Arme is strong enough,
that
strikes
With the sword of Iustice: Still me thinkes the Dutchesse
Haunts me: there, there:
it
is nothing but my mellancholy.
O Penitence, let me truely tast thy Cup.
That
throwes men downe, onely
to
raise them
up
.
Exit.
SCENA. III.
Antonio, Delio, Eccho, (from the Dutchesse Graue.)
Yond is the Cardinall's window: This fortification
Grew from the ruines of an auncient Abbey:
And
to
yond side of the riuer, lies a wall
(Peece of a Cloyster)
which
in
my opinion
Giues the best Eccho,
that
you euer heard;
So
hollow, and
so
dismall, and withall
So
plaine
in
the destinction of
our
words,
That
many have supposde
it
is a Spirit
That
answeres.
I do loue these auncient ruynes;
We
neuer tread
upon
them, but
we
set
Our
foote
upon
some reuerend History,
And questionles, here
in
this open Court
(
Which
now lies naked
to
the iniuries
Of stormy weather) some men lye Enterr'd
Lou'd the Church
so
well, and gaue
so
largely
to
it
,
They thought
it
should have canopide their Bones
'Till Doombes-day: But all things have their end:
Churches, and Citties (
which
have diseases
like
to
men)
Must have
like
death
that
we
have.
Like
death
that
we
have.
Now the Eccho hath caught you:
It
groan'd (me thought) and gaue
A very deadly Accent?
Deadly Accent.
I told you
it
was a pretty one: You may make
it
A Huntes-man, or a Faulconer, a Musitian,
Or a Thing of Sorrow.
A Thing of Sorrow.
Aye sure:
that
suites
it
best.
That
suites
it
best.
It
is very
like
my wiues voyce.
Aye, wifes-voyce.
Come: let's
us
walke farther from
it
:
I Would not have you go
to
the Cardinalls to night:
Do not.
Do not,
Wisdome doth not more moderate, wasting Sorrow
Then time: take time
for
it
: be mindfull of thy safety.
Be mindfull of thy safety.
Necessitie compells me:
Make scruteny throughout the passes
Of your owne life; you
will
find
it
impossible
To
flye your fate.
O flye your fate.
Harke: the dead stones seeme
to
have pitty
on
you
And giue you good counsell.
Eccho, I
will
not talke with thee;
For
thou art a dead Thing.
Thou art a dead Thing.
My Dutchesse is asleepe now,
And
her
litle-Ones, I hope sweetly: o Heauen
Shall I neuer see
her
more?
Neuer see
her
more:
I mark'd not one repetition of the Eccho
But
that
: and
on
the sudden, a cleare light
Presented me a face folded
in
sorrow.
Your fancy; meerely.
Come: I
will
be out of this Ague;
For
to
liue thus, is not indeed
to
liue:
It
is a mockery, and abuse of life,
I
will
not henceforth saue my selfe
by
halues,
Loose all, or nothing.
Your owne vertue saue you:
I
will
fetch your eldest sonne; and second you:
It
may be
that
the sight of his owne blood
Spred
in
so
sweet a figure, may beget
The more compassion.
How euer, fare you well:
Though
in
our
miseries, Fortune have a part,
Yet,
in
our
noble suffrings, she hath none,
Contempt of paine,
that
we
may call
our
owne.
Exe.
SCENA. IIII.
Cardinall, Pescara, Malateste, Rodorigo, Gisolan, Bosola, Ferdinand, Antonio, Seruant.
You shall not watch to night
by
the sicke Prince,
His Grace is very well recouer'd.
Good my Lord suffer
us
.
O,
by
no
meanes:
The noyce, and change of obiect
in
his eye,
Doth more distract him: I pray, all
to
bed,
And though you heare him
in
his violent fit,
Do not rise, I intreate you.
So
sir,
we
shall not,
Nay, I must have you promise
Upon
your honors,
for
I was enioyn'd
to
it
By
himselfe; and he seem'd
to
vrge
it
sencibly.
Let
our
honors bind this trifle.
Nor any of your followers.
Neither.
It
may be
to
make triall of your promise
When he is a sleepe, my selfe
will
rise, and faigne
Some of his mad trickes, and crie out
for
helpe,
And faigne my selfe
in
danger.
If your throate were cutting,
I would not come at you, now I have protested against
it
.
Why, I thanke you.
It
was a foule storme to night.
The Lord Ferdinand's chamber, shooke
like
an Ozier.
It
was nothing but pure kindnesse
in
the Diuell,
To
rocke his owne child.
Exeunt.
The reason why I would not suffer these
About my brother, is, because at midnight
I may with better priuacy, conuay
Iulias body,
to
her
owne Lodging: O, my Conscience!
I would pray now: but the Diuell takes away my heart
For
hauing any confidence
in
Praier.
About this houre, I appointed Bosola
To
fetch the body: when he hath seru'd my turne,
He dies.
Exit.
Hah?
it
was the Cardinalls voyce: I heard him name,
Bosola, and my death: listen, I heare ones footing.
Strangling is a very quiein death.
Nay then I see, I must stand
upon
my Guard.
What say
to
that
? whisper, softly: do you agree
to
it
?
So
it
must be done
in
the darke: the Cardinall
Would not
for
a thousand pounds, the Doctor should see
it
.
Exit.
My death is plotted; here is the consequence of murther.
We
value not desert, nor Christian breath,
When
we
know blacke deedes, must be cur'de with death.
Here stay Sir, and be confident, I pray:
I
will
fetch you a darke Lanthorne.
Exit
Could I take him at his prayers,
There were hope of pardon.
Fall right my sword:
I
will
not giue thee
so
much leysure, as
to
pray.
O, I am gone: Thou hast ended a long suit,
In
a mynut.
What art thou?
A most wretched thing,
That
onely have thy benefit
in
death,
To
appeare my selfe.
Where are you Sir?
Very neere my home: Bosola?
O misfortune.
Smother thy pitty, thou art dead else: Antonio?
The man I would have sau'de 'boue mine owne life?
We
are meerely the Starres tennys-balls (strooke, and banded
Which
way please them) o good Antonio,
I
will
whisper one thing
in
thy dying eare,
Shall make thy heart breake quickly: thy faire Dutchesse
And two sweet Children.
Their very names
Kindle a litle life
in
me.
Are murdrd!
Some men have wish'd
to
die.
At the hearing of sad tydings: I am glad
That
I shall do
it
in
sadnes: I would not now
Wish my wounds balm'de, nor heal'd:
for
I have
no
vse
To
put my life
to
:
In
all
our
Quest of Greatnes;
(
Like
wanton Boyes, whose pastime is their care)
We
follow after bubbles, blowne
in
the ayre.
Pleasure of life, what is
it
? onely the good houres
Of an Ague: meerely a preparatiue
to
rest,
To
endure vexation: I do not aske
The processe of my death: onely commend me
To
Delio.
Breake heart:
And let my Sonne, flie the Courts of Princes.
Thou seem'st
to
have lou'd Antonio?
I brought him hether,
To
have reconcil'd him
to
the Cardinall.
I do not aske thee
that
:
Take him
up
, if thou tender thine owne life,
And beare him, where the Lady Iulia
Was wont
to
lodge: O, my fate moues swift.
I have this Cardinall,
in
the forge already,
Now I
will
bring him
to
the hammer: (O direfull misprision;)
I
will
not Imitate things glorious,
No
more then base: I
will
be mine owne example.
On
,
on
: and looke thou represent,
for
silence,
The thing thou bear'st.
Exeunt.
SCENA. V.
Cardinall (with a Booke) Bosola, Pescara, Malateste, Rodorigo, Ferdinand, Delio, Seruant with Antonio's body.
I am puzzell'd
in
a question about hell:
He saies,
in
hell, there is one materiall fire,
And yet
it
shall not burne all men alike.
Lay him
by
: How tedious is a guilty conscience?
When I looke into the Fish-ponds,
in
my Garden,
Me thinkes I see a thing, arm'd with a Rake
That
seemes
to
strike at me: Now? art thou come? thou look'st ghastly:
There sits
in
thy face, some great determination,
Mix'd with some feare.
Thus
it
lightens into action:
I am come
to
kill thee.
Hah? helpe:
our
Guard.
Thou art deceiu'd:
They are out of thy howling.
Hold: and I
will
faithfully deuide
Reuenewes with thee.
Thy prayers, and proffers
Are both vnseasonable.
Raise the Watch:
we
are betraid.
I have confinde your flight:
I
will
suffer your retreyt
to
Iulias Chamber,
But
no
further.
Helpe:
we
are betraid.
Listen:
My Dukedome,
for
rescew.
Fye
upon
his counterfeyting.
Why,
it
is not the Cardinall.
Yes, yes,
it
is he:
But I
will
see him hang'd, ere I
will
goe downe
to
him.
Here is a plot
upon
me, I am assaulted: I am lost,
Vnlesse some rescew.
He doth this pretty well
But
it
will
not serue;
to
laugh me out of mine honour.
The sword is at my throat:
You would not bawle
so
lowd then.
Come, come: lets
us
goe
to
bed: he told
us
thus much aforehand.
He wish'd you should not come at him: but beleeu
it
,
The accent of the voyce sounds not
in
iest.
I
will
downe
to
him, howsoeuer, and with engines
Force ope the doores.
Let
us
follow him aloofe,
And note how the Cardinall
will
laugh at him.
There is
for
you first: 'cause you shall not vnbarracade the doore
To
let
in
rescew.
He kills the Seruant.
What cause hast thou
to
pursue my life?
Looke there:
Antonio?
Slaine
by
my hand vnwittingly:
Pray, and be sudden: when thou kill'dst thy sister,
Thou tookst from Iustice
her
most equall ballance,
And left
her
naught but
her
sword.
O mercy.
Now
it
seemes thy Greatnes was onely outward:
For
thou fall'st faster of thy selfe, then calamitie
Can driue thee: I
will
not wast longer time: There.
Thou hast hurt me:
Againe:
Shall I die
like
a Leuoret
Without any resistance? helpe, helpe, helpe:
I am slaine.
The allarum? giue me a fresh horse:
Rally the vaunt-guard: or the day is lost:
Yeeld, yeeld: I giue you the honour of Armes,
Shake my Sword ouer you,
will
you yeilde?
Helpe me, I am your brother.
The diuell?
My brother fight
upon
the aduerse party?
There flies your ransome.
He wounds the Cardinall, and (
in
the scuffle) giues Bosola his death wound..
O Iustice:
I suffer now,
for
what hath former been:
Sorrow is held the eldest child of sin.
Now you are braue fellowes:
Cæsars Fortune was harder then Pompeys:
Cæsar died
in
the armes of prosperity,
Pompey at the feete of disgrace: you both died
in
the field,
The paine is nothing: paine many times, is taken away, with
The apprehension of greater, (as the tooth-ache with the sight
Of a Barbor,
that
comes
to
pull
it
out) there is Philosophy
for
you.
Now my reuenge is perfect: sinke (thou maine cause
Of my vndoing) the last part of my life,
Hath done me best seruice.
He kills Ferdinand.
Giue me some wet hay, I am broken winded,
I do account this world but a dog-kennell:
I
will
vault credit, and affect high pleasures,
Beyond death.
He seemes
to
come
to
himselfe, now he is
so
neere the bottom.
My sister, o! my sister: there is the cause of
it
.
Whether
we
fall
by
ambition, blood, or lust,
Like
Diamonds,
we
are cut with
our
owne dust.
Thou hast thy payment too.
Yes, I hold my weary soule,
in
my teeth,
It
is ready
to
part from me: I do glory
That
thou,
which
stood'st
like
a huge Piramid
Begun
upon
a large, and ample base,
Shalt end
in
a little point a kind of nothing.
How now (my Lord?)
O sad disastre.
How comes this?
Reuenge,
for
the duchesse of Malfy, murdered
By
the Aragonian brethren:
for
Antonio,
Slaine
by
his hand:
for
lustful Iulia,
Poyson'd
by
this man; and lastly,
for
my selfe,
(
That
was an Actor
in
the maine of all,
Much 'gainst mine owne good nature, yet
in
the end
Neglected.)
How now (my Lord.)
Looke
to
my brother:
He gaue
us
these large wounds, as
we
were strugling
Here
in
the rushes: And now, I pray, let me
Be layd
by
, and neuer thought of.
How fatally (
it
seemes) he did withstand,
His owne rescew?
Thou wretched thing of blood,
How came Antonio
by
his death?
In
a mist: I know not how,
Such a mistake, as I have often seene
In
a play: O, I am gone,
We
are onely
like
dead wals, or vaulted graues,
That
ruin'd, yeildes
no
eccho: Fare you well,
It
may be paine: but
no
harme
to
me
to
die,
In
so
good a quarrell: O this gloomy world,
In
what a shadow, or deepe pit of darknesse,
Doth (womanish, and fearefull) mankind liue?
Let worthy mindes, nere stagger
in
distrust
To
suffer death, or shame
for
what is iust,
Mine is an other voyage.
The noble Delio, as I came
to
the Pallace,
Told me of Antonio's being here, and shew'd me
A pritty gentleman his sonne and heire.
O Sir, you come too late.
I heard
so
, and
Was arm'd
for
it
ere I came: Let
us
make noble vse
Of this great ruine; and ioyne all
our
force
To
establish this yong hopefull Gentleman
In
his mothers right. These wretched eminent things
Leaue
no
more fame behind them, then should one
Fall
in
a frost, and leaue his print
in
snow,
As soone as the sun shines,
it
euer melts,
Both forme, and matter: I have euer thought
Nature doth nothing
so
great,
for
great men,
As when she is pleas'd,
to
make them Lords of truth:
Integrity of life, is fames best friend,
Which
noblely (beyond Death) shall crowne the end.
Exeunt.

To the
READER

1687?
MOst
Prefaces
are (Effectually)
Apologies
; and neither the
Book
, nor the
Author
, one Jot the
Better
for them. If the
Book
be
Good
, it will not
Need
an
Apology
; If
Bad
, it will not
Bear
One: For where a man thinks, by
Calling
himself
Noddy
, in the
Epistle
, to
Atone
, for
Shewing
himself to be one, in the
Test
; He does (with Respect to the Dignity of an
Author
) but
Bind up Two Fools
in
One Cover
. But there's no more Trusting some People with
Pen
,
Ink
,
and Paper
, then the Maddest Extravagants in
Bedlam
, with
Fire
,
Sword
, or
Poyson
. He that
Writes Ill
, and
Sees
it, why does he
Wrote on
? And, with a kind of
Malice Prepense
,
Murder
the
Ingenious
part of
Mankind
? He that
Really Believes
he Writes
Well
; why does he pretend to
Think
Otherwise? Now take it which way you please, a man runs a Risque of his
Reputation
, for want, either of
Skill
, and
Judgment
, the
One
way; Or of
Good Faith
, and
Candor
the
Other
. Beside a Mighty Oversight, in
Imagining
to bring himself off, from an
Ill
Thing,
Done
, or
Said
, by Telling the World that he did it for
This
or
That Reason
. When a Book has once past the
Press
into the
Publique
; there's no more
Recalling
of it, then of a
Word Spoken
, out of the
Air
again. And a man may as well hope to Reverse the
Decree
of his
Mortality
, as the
Fate
of his
Writings
. In short: When the
Dice
are
Cast
, the
Author
must stand his
Chance
.
Now that I may not be thought to Enterfere with my self, by
Declaiming
against
One Preface
in
Another
: I do here previously Renounce to All the Little Arts and Forms of Bespeaking the
Good Will
of the
Reader
; As a
Practice
, not only
Mean
,
Light
, and
Unprofitable
; but wholly
Contrary
to the
Bent
of
My Inclination
; as well as
Inconsistent
with the very
Drift
, and
Quality
of my
Design
. For These
Papers
were
Written
, Indifferently, for the
Enformation
of the
Multitude
; and for the
Reproof
of a
Faction
:
Two Interests
that I am not much
Sollicitous
, or
Ambitious
, to
Oblige
: And upon
This Consideration
it is, that I have
Address'd
them to the
Reader
in
Generall
; as a
Calculation
that will serve for
All Meridians
: But if I could have Resolved upon a
Dedication
, with any
Particular Mark
, or
Epithete
of
Distinction
; it should have been,
To the IGNORANT
,
the SEDITIOUS
, or
the SCHISMATICAL Reader
; for
There
, properly, lies
my Bus'ness
.
The Reader will find in the
First Number
of This Collection, the
True Intent
, and
Design
of the
Undertaking
; And he will likewise find, in the very
Date
of it, (
April
13, 1681.) the
Absolute Necessity
of some Such
Application
, to Encounter the
Notorious Falshoods
; the
Malicious Scandals
, and the
Poysonous Doctrines
of
That Season
.
Whether I had Sufficient
Ground
, or
Reason
, for the Warmth I have Exprest in These Papers, upon Several Occasions, (out of an Affectionate Sense of my
Duty
, and a
Zeal
for the
Peace
,
Welfare
, and
Safety
of my
Country
;) I
Dare
, and I
Do Appeal
to the
King
, and his
Ministers
; to the
Consciences
of as many of his Majesties
Subjects
, as are not
Stark Blind
because they
WILL
not
See
; and to the Justice of the Nation. I do
Appeal
, I say, to his Majesties
Proclamations
; to his
Royal Declaration
; Several
Orders
of
Councel
; the
Examinations
, and
Confessions
of
Unquestionable Witnesses
; The
Solemnity
of so many
Tryals
,
Sentences
, and
Executions
; and the
Criminals
, Every Man of 'em, Either
Acknowledging
the
Crime
, or
Justifying
the
Treason
: But the
FACT
, however made as
Clear
as the
Day
. There's the
Flight
of the
Conspirators
; Their
Arms Seiz'd
; Their
Councels Laid Open
;
Men Listed
; The
Methods
of the
Confederacy Detected
, to the very
Time
, and
Place
for the
Perpetration
of the
Villany
; to the very
Circumstance
of the
Providential Fire
at
Newmarket
, that
Disappointed
it. I have All These
Demonstrative Proofs
, and
Convincing Evidences
, to
Warrant
me in the most
Violent Presumptions
of a
Rebellion
in
Agitation
: And the
Phanatiques Themselves
made good the
Worst
Things that ever I said of the
Party
: In
Vindication
of the
Importunity
of All my
Foreboding
, if not
Prophetical Suspicions
: Nay, they were come to the very
Point
, and
Crisis
of the
Operation
, of That
Unaccountable
, and
Amazing Vote
. [
If his Majesty shall come by Any Violent Death (which God Forbid) it shall
be
Reveng'd to the Utmost upon the Papists
.] The
King
, and the
Duke
were to be
Murder'd
by
Republican
, and
Fanatical Rebells
:
There's
your
VIOLENT DEATH
, And
Then
[
Reuenge it upon the Papists
:] For [
the Thing
(says
Keeling
)
was to be laid upon the Papists as a Branch of the Popish Plot
. Walcots Tryal. Fol.9.] And the
Next
Step was, for the
Traytors
to
Unriddle
the
Mystery
, and to
Expound
,
Who
were the
Papists
. [
The Lord Mayor
,
and the Sheriffs
]
were Three
of 'em.
They
, were to be Kill'd; And [
as many of the
Lieutenancy
as they could get
;
And the Principal Ministers of State
;
My Lord
Halifax,
My Lord
Rochester,
and my
Lord Keeper: (
They
were
Three Papists more
.)
My Lord
Keeper
was to have been
Hang'd
upon the same Post that
College
had hung
.
Sir
John Moor
to be
Hung-up
in
Guildhall,
as a Betrayer of the Rights and Liberties of the City. And the Judges Lordships to be
Flayed,
and
Stuff'd,
and
Hung-up
in
Westminster Hall:
And a great many of the
Pensionary Parliament Hang'd-up,
as Betrayers of the Rights of the People
. Walcots Tryal, p.15.] You have here,
a Practical Explanation of
the
True-Protestant Way
, (in case of
the King's Violent Death
)
of Revenging it to the Utmost upon the Papists
.] And This Intended
Assassination
(says
Ferguson
(in the same Page) [
Is a Glorious Action, and such an Action as
I HOPE TO SEE PUBLIQUELY GRATIFY'D BY PARLIAMENT;
And Question not but you will be Fam'd for it, and
Statues
Erected for you, with the Title of
LIBERATORES PATRIAE.
Ibid
.] Now when Matters were come to
This Pass
once, I think it was High Time to Write
Observators
.
I might Enlarge my self, upon the
Inducements
that Mov'd me to Enter upon This
Province
; The
Needfullness
, of some
Popular Medium
for the
Rectifying
of
Vulgar Mistakes
, and for
Instilling
of
Dutyfull
, and
Honest Principles
into the
Common People
, upon That
Turbulent
and
Seditious Juncture
: But I am not Willing to
Clogg
my
Preface
, with the
Repetition
of what I have spoken so
Expressly
to, in the
Book
.
I am now to Advertise the
Reader
, in the next Place; That as I have not Strain'd, so much as
One Syllable
, in the
Whole Course
of
These Papers
, beyond the
Line
of
Truth
, Nor let fall
One Word
,
Contrary
to my
Conscience;
Nor
Layd-on
so much as
One False Colour
, for a
Blind
, or a
Disguise
: As I have not done any Thing of All This, I say; Nor
Gratify'd
so much as
One Passion
to the Prejudice, of any
MAN
, or
THING
; or of
Common Justice it Self
: So neither, on the
Other
hand, was I less
Cautious
, and
Considerate
, in the
Undertaking
of This
Duty
, then I have been
Clear
, and
Impartial
, in the
Discharge
, and
Manage
of it.
I was no sooner Possess't, of the
Reason
, and the
Expedience
of the
Thing
; but I feel presently to
Deliberate
upon the
Individious Difficulties
; The
Scandals
,
Reproaches
, and a Thousand Other
Mischiefs
, and
Inconveniencies
, that would probably
Attend
it. I laid them All
before
me; And upon a
Full Computation
of the
Matter
,
Pro
and
Con
; I Resolv'd, at last, to Put
pen to paper
; not without some
Vanity
perhaps, in
Affecting
the
Honour
of being
Revil'd
, but the
Blasphemers
of
God
, and the
King
. I shall say Nothing of the
Traytors
; The
Papists
; The
Fidlers
; The
All-manner-of-Rogues
, and
Debauchees
that they have
made
me: For their
Cause
is
Founded
upon a
Sacrilegious Hypocrisy
;
Maintain'd
by
Fraud
,
Scandal
, and
Imposture
. And when they have a mind to
Blacken
a man, 'tis not a
Straw
matter, for any
Foundation
of
Fact
, or
History
: But
Paint
him as like the
Devil
as they
Can
; and to make short Work on't,
One Fanatique
Sits to
Another
, for the
Picture
. But
These Scurrilities
have more of
Noise
in 'em, then of
Weight
: And Those People that had the face to
Calumniate Charles the First
, for a
TYRANT
, and a
PAPIST
; And the
Confidence
, at This very day, to do as much for
Charles the Second
; They that
Preach REBELLION
out of the
GOSPEL
; Give it the
Name
of
GOD'S TRUTH
,
GOD'S CAUSE
; And offer up the
Bloud
of
Kings
as an
Acceptable Sacrifice
to
Jesus Christ
: What
Christian
will not
Value
himself, upon the
Reputation
of lying under the
Scourge
of
Those Tongues
, and
Pens
, that Offer these
Outrages
to their
Maker
, and their
Saviour
? So that these
Clamours
, and
Maledictions
, I look upon, as Matter, rather of
Advantage
, then
Discredit
; Where
Loyalty
to the
King
, and to the
Church
, is made the
Crime
: But yet I must Confess, I had
Some Other Mortifications
in my
Thought
, that went a little
Nearer
me.
As first, the
Indecency
of a
Gentlemans
Entring into a
Street-Brawl
, (and
Barefac'd
too) with the
Sink
of
Mankind
, both for
Quality
, and
Wickedness
. 21y. The
Disproportion
, and the
Indecorum
of the Thing, for an
Old Fellow
that now Writes
Sixty Eight
, to run about, a
Masquerading
, an
Dialoguing
of it, in
Twenty Fantastical Shapes
, only to furnish a
Popular Entertainment
, and
Diversion
. 31y. The
Scandalous Appearance
of it, for Me to take up the
Profession
, and
Bus'ness
of a
Pamphleteer
; and (almost) to Lose the
Name
of my
Family
, by it, in
Exchange
for That of the
Observator
. 41y. I had This Prospect before me too. What
Construction
would be made upon't; (If I may speak it with
Modesty
) even to the
Lessening
of my
Character
; And Consequently, to my Detriment, Every way, as well in Respect of
Fortune
, as
Esteem
: For men are apt, in such Cases as This, to
Mistake
, the
Intent
, as well as the
Reason
of the
Office
; and to Impute the most
Sacred
, and
Consciencious Zeal
of an
Upright Heart
, in the performance of the most
Important
, and
Necessary Duty
, only to a
Levity
of
Mind
, perchance; Or in Other Terms; to an Over
Officious
, and
Pragmatical Itch of Medling
: It makes a man to be lookt upon, as if a
Pamphlet
were his
Masterpiece
; and when he's once
Nail'd
to
That Post
, he may reckon upon't, that he' at the
Top
of his
Preferment
. Upon These
Four Difficulties
, I Reason'd with my self, after This Manner. To the
First
; What do I care, for having so much
Dirt
Thrown at me, that will
Wash off
again? And at the worst, the Engaging with such a
Rabble
of
Contaminated Varlets
, is no more than
Leaping
into the
Mud
to help my
Father
.
Secondly
.
'Tis not for a man in years
, to do so and so. Well! And here's a
Reputative Circumstance
, on the
One
hand, against an
Indispensable Duty
, on the
Other
. The
Common people
are
Poyson'd
, and will run
Stark Mad
, if they be not
Cur'd
: Offer them
Reason
, without
Fooling
, and it will never
Down
with them: And give them
Fooling
, without
Argument
, they're never the
Better
for't. Let 'em
Alone
, and All's
Lost
. So that the
Mixture
is become as
Necessary
, as the
Office
; And it has been
My Part
, only to
Season
the
One
with the
Other
.
Thirdly
, I must Set the
Conscience
of the Action, against the
Reproch
. And
Lastly
;
'Tis nothing to me what Other People
Think,
so long as I am Conscious to my Self that I Do what I
Ought.
All This I Computed upon,
before-hand
; And thus far, I have not been
Deceiv'd
in my
Account
. I have been
Baited
with
Thousands
upon
Thousands
of
Libells
. I have Created
Enemies
that do me the
Honour
to
Hate
me, perhaps, next to the
King Himself
(God Bless him) and the
Royal Family
. Their
Scandals
are
Blown over
: Their
Malice
,
Defeated
, And whenever
my Hour comes
, I am ready to Deliver up my
Soul
, which the
Conscience
of an
Honest Man
, as to what I have done, in
This Particular
: And I do here Declare, in the
Presence
of an
All-Seeing
, and an
All-Knowing God
, That as I have never yet receiv'd any
Answer
, more then
Cavil
, and
Shuffling
, to the
Doctrine
, and
Reasoning
of
These Papers
: So I never
made use
of Any
Sophism
, or
Double Meaning
, in Defence of the
Cause
that I have here taken upon me to
Assert
: but have dealt
Plainly
, and
Above-Bord
, without either
Fallacy
, or
Collusion
.
After This
View
of the
Worst side
of my
Case
; (And (in truth) a kind of
Abstract
of it, in
Minutes
) I should be Extremely wanting, both to
God
and
Man
, in not taking
This Occasion
, of making
known
to the
world
, the
Many Generous Instances
of
Affection
, and
Respect
, which I have received, not only from the most
Considerable
Part of his Majesties
Loyal Subjects
of
All qualities
, and
Degrees
; but
Particularly
from the
Two Famous Universities themselves
: And, in short, from the most
Eminent Persons
of the
Long Robe
, in their
Several Professions
: In
Testimony
of their
Favourable Acceptance
of my
Honest Endeavours
toward the Service, both of the
Church
, & the
State
. And this I am Obliged to leave behind me, upon
Record
; out of a
Double Right
, &
Regard
, as well to my
Friends
, as to my
Self
: For I reckon upon it, as an
Accumulation
of
Honour
, to
Me
, to be
Rescu'd
out of the hands of
Publique Enemies
, and
Apostates
, by Men of the Clear
Contrary Character
; That is to say; by Men of
Unquestionable Integrity
, and of
Unspotted Faith
.
My
Back Friends
are as
Merry
, now, as
a Laugh on One side of the Mouth
can Make 'em; at the
Conceit
of calling the several
Presents
which have been made me (and they are very
Considerable
) by the name of a
Gathering
; and they do not Stick to put it about, That I was my
Own Sollicitor
for the
Begging
of it. I have been Told of One, that
said
as much;
for whose sake
, I would Advise
All Parents
to take it for a
Warning
, not to
Stuff
their
Childrens heads
so Damnably, with
Greek and Latin
as to leave no
Room
for
Brains
, and
Good Manners
. But what if it
be a Gathering
? Are not All
Publique Benevolences
;
Publique Works
;
Publique Acknowledgments
; the
same Thing
? Neither do I find any more
Scandal
, in receiving a
Reward
for a
Service
in a
Common Cause
, then in a
Lawyers
taking a
Fee
, in a
Private
One: But be it what it
will
: I shall Transmit the
Acknowledgment
of it, with This Paper, as the
Glory of my Life
: And Value my self Incomparably more upon so
Eminent
a
Mark
of a
General Esteem
; then upon the
Advantage
of
Ten times a Greater sum
, by
Any Other way
. But
Gatherings
, with some People, are only
Honourable
, when they are Apply'd to the
Maintaining
of
Conspirators
, and
Affidavit-Men
: And they Account
Money
much better
Bestow'd
upon the
Subversion
of the
Government
, then toward the
Defending
of it: but
That Orange is Squeez'd a far as 'twill Drop, already
.
Now to the
Calumny
of
My Setting This Bus'ness afoot
;
First
, I thank God, that neither my
Mind
, nor my
Condition
were ever Sunk
so
Low, yet, as to
Descend
to
That way of Application
. 21
y
, As I hope to be Sav'd, the Matter was Proceeded upon, in
Several Places
, and a
Long time
, before ever I had the Least
Inkling
, or
Imagination
of it; and when it was so far
Advanc'd
,
without my Privity
, I must Certainly have been both a Great
Fool
, and a Great
Clown
, either to have
Oppos'd
, or
Refus'd
, a token of so
Obliging
, and so
Generous
a
Respect
. To Conclude; If any man has been so
Misled
, as to
Intend
That for a
Personal Charity
; which I cannot
Honourably
Own the
Receiving
of, under
That Notion
; I am ready to Return him his Proportion, with a Thousand Acknowledgments: But This shall not Hinder me yet, from
Cherishing
in my
Thoughts
, the
Remembrance
of what
Honour
soever has been done me for the sake of the
Publique
.
The Reflexions that have been Pass'd upon my
Quality
, and
Conversation
, need no Further Answer, then to Appeal to my very
Name
, and my
Acquaintance
: but for the
Charge
of being a
Papist
, it is as
False
, as it is
Malicious
.
I am to say One Word more now, concerning my
L. Shaftsbury
; whose
Name
, and
Title
, I have often Occasion to make mention of, in This Book. The
Reader
is to take Notice, that it is Intended of the
Late Earl of Shaftsbury
, who Dy'd at
Amsterdam
,
Jan
. 1682/3.
The Surviving Heir of That Honour, and Family, having ever Demean'd himself with a Remarkable Loyalty, and Respect, toward the King, and his Government

THE OBSERVATOR. In
DIALOGUE
.
SATURDAY
, March 11. 1681.
sic
WHIG
. COme; I'le shew ye my
study,
Tory.
TORY
. Why you have got a Brave
Library
here.
Wh
. For a
Choice Collection,
let me tell ye, as any is in
Christendom
.
To
. You have all the
Greek
and
Latin Fathers,
I suppose; the
Councells,
the
Schoolmen,
and those People.
Wh
. I had'em all; but there's a great deal of
Trash;
and so I e'en rid my hands of'em; though some of'em did pretty well too; considering those
Dark Times
. Now here can I sit as
Snug
as a
Hare
in her
Form,
and Chat away a Winters Evening with a
Good Fire,
a
Pipe,
and a
Friend,
and never feel how the time spends.
To
. Well! Andy why should not You and I keep our
Conferences
here too?
Wh
. Best of all: There's no body within hearing; and then we have our
Books
and
Papers
about us, and all in such Order, that I'le lay my Finger, Blindfold, upon any book you'le call for.
To
. But what Subject are they mostly of?
Wh
. Matters of
State, History, Travells,
The Rights and Power of the
People, Reformation, Religion, Discipline, Admonitions, Remonstrances, Petitions, Appeals;
as ye see'em mark'd upon the Shelves. But all this is nothing, you'l say, when y'ave seen my
Gallery
. Open that same Door before ye.
To
. Bless me! What a Treasure's here?
Wh
. Look ye now. That side is all
News-Books,
and
Political Divinity
.
To
. You mean
Polemical
Divinity I suppose.
Wh
. Ay Ay; 'Tis all one for that. Now all to'ther side is
Dissenting Protestants;
as
Cartwright, Brown, Barrow, Robinson, Hetherington, Trask, Naylor, Best, Biddle, Muggleton
. And here are your
Muncerians, Apostoliques, Separatists, Libertines, Georgites, Familists, Ranters Seekers, Sweet-Singers, Antinomians, Arrians, Socinians, Millenayres, Quakers:
And in Two words; all the
Godly Party
. They make Fourteen Folio's of Catalogue.
To
. But ha'ye no
Manuscripts?
Wh
. Yes I have Three cases there beyond the Chimny, that I wou'd not change for
Bodlies Library
three times over.
To
. What do they treat of?
Wh
. Two of 'em are altogether upon the
Art of Government,
and the
Third
is Cramm'd with
Lampoon
and
Satyr
. You sha'not name me any one Copy that has scap'd me; nor any Exigent of State; but I'le furnish ye out of these Papers with an Expedient for't.
To
. And wherein does this
Art of Government
Consist?
Wh
. In
Foresight, Experience, Presence of Thought, Prudence of Direction,
and
Vigour of Execution
. To be short; Every Motion of the
Head,
the
Eye,
the
Hand,
the
Foot,
the
Body,
Contributes a part to this Great Work.
To
. Is it a Science that may be Convey'd by
Instruction
?
Wh
. With as much Ease as
Fencing,
or
Dancing
. There are Three or Four
Dissenting Academies
here about the Town, where People are taught to
Nod, Wink, Gape, Cough, Spit;
Nay the very
Turning
of their
Hum's
and
Haw's,
by
Rule and Method;
when to
Smite the Breast,
and when to
Dust the Cushion;
when to
Leap
in the
Pulpit,
and when
to Swim;
when to be
Serene,
and when to
Thunder:
Nay the
Faces
they are to make at every
Period;
and the very
Measure
of their
pauses;
that the
Parenthesis
may be large enough for the
Groans,
&
Ejaculations
of the
Secret ones
to
Play
in; they are taught to Pray for the
King
with
One Tone
and
Countenance,
and for the
Parliament
with
another
.
To
. I have Observ'd them indeed to Cry with a Loud Voice,
Lord! strengthen the Hands of the One,
& then to drop the Note into a kinde of a Piping whisper, with a
Lord! Turn the Heart of the Other;
which is as much as to say,
Alas! the Poor Gentleman is out of his way, and we must set all hands at work to bring him to comply with his
Parliament,
though that
Handy work,
at last, bring his
Royall Head
to the
Scaffold.
Wh
. If you wou'd not be a
Rogue
now and tell tales, I could let ye in to the whole
Popular Mystery;
and shew ye the
Folly,
and the
Vanity
of any other Claim to
Sovereign Power
. And then
I
have all the
Prints
brought me as soon as ever they come out.
To
. Pre'thee let's fall to work then.
Wh
. Come, I'le give you a sight of one of my
Boxes
first; but I must be gone in a quarter of an hour upon absolute Necessity.
To
. Well
!
And whether in such hast?
Wh
. There's One at
Newington
has promis'd me an
Answer
to the
Dissenters Sayings;
and then I am told of a
Godly Divine
at
Clapham,
that has a
Reply
ready to the
Notes upon College
.
To
. Let's make the best of our time then. Stay a little; what have we here?
Wh
. Every thing is
Titled,
ye see, ready to your hand; so that you may Pick and Chuse.
To
. Let me see then.
Pious Frauds; Mentall Reservations; Infallibility of the Assembly; Baxters Saints; Cases of Conscience; Dispensations, Contributions, Maxims, Intelligence, Orders, Committees, Juryes, Caballs, Religion, Property, Demands, Proposals, Grievances, Pretenses, Salvo's, Distinctions, Explanations, Projects, Directions, Advices, Resolutions, Invectives, Fictions, Forms of Reproaches,
suited to
All Persons, Orders,
and
Qualities; True-Protestant Privileges;
The
Doctrine
of
Probabilityes,
and
Implicit Obedience
.
Wh
. Now upon all these Heads, ye have
Authoritys, Precedents;
and all the
Colours, Arguments,
and
Elucidatons
that the matter will bear.
To
. But your
Pious Frauds, Mentall Reservations, Infallibility, Dispensations, Salvo's, Distinctions, Probabilityes, Implicit Faith;
These are all
Popish Points
.
Wh
. They are so, when they are apply'd to the service of the Church of
Rome:
but the
True Protestant-Cause Sanctifies
the
Principle
. As there's a great difference betwixt the
Popes Excommunicating
of an
Hereticall Prince;
and the
Generall Assemblys Excommunicating
of an
Antichristian, Episcopall Prince;
betwixt a
Popish Gunpowder-Treason,
in the
Cellers, under the Parliament-House;
and a
Gunpowder Commission
to
Kill
and
Slay
within the
walls
of the
Same House, above ground;
though to Carnal Eyes they may both appear to
Center
in the same
Point:
And so in like manner, betwixt a
Conspiracy
of
Papists
to
cut off the King,
and
Subvert the Government;
and a
True-Protestant-Association,
to the very
same Effect:
Nay with this Advantage too; that the Latter Propounds the Accomplishing of that, in a matter of a
month
or
six weeks,
which the Zeal of their Fore-fathers was at least
Ten,
or a
dozen years a doing
.
To
. 'Tis a Great Ease for a man to have all these subjects
Common-Plac'd
to his hand.
Wh
. Right. And where you may turn to any thing you have a mind to see, with a
wet Finger
.
To
. But Pray'e How do you approve (in many of our
Seisures
) of the
Application
of
Popish Trinkets
to
Prophane Uses,
which were by them Dedicated to the service of a
Superstitious Religion?
Wh
. You cannot Imagine, though an
Embroder'd Cope
may be an
Abomination,
what a
Cordial the Pearl
of it is to a
True-Protestant Professor
.
Lambs-Wool
drinks no way better than out of a
Chalice
. Or in other Cases; 'Tis but Destroying the
Popish Form
of an
Idolatrous Vessell,
and the
Intrinsick Value
is never the less
Current
according to the
Standard
of the
Reformation
. The
Picture
of the
Blessed Virgin,
with our
Saviour
in her Arms, is never a jot the worse for
sale
to a
Painter,
for being an object of
Idolatry
about the
Altar
.
To
. And yet I have seen it Committed to the
Flames,
but it has been an Oversight, betwixt the
Zeal
and the
Ignorance
of the
Magistrate
. How many
Curious Crucifixes,
and
Reliques,
with
Delicate Inlayings,
and
Carvings
have I seen Expos'd at
Gill
the
Constables
in
Westminster;
truly, at very
Reasonable Rates?
Wh
. Not likely; but then ye must know, they were
Seiz'd
in
One Capacity,
and
sold
in
Another;
for they were
vended
in the Contemplation of the
Workmanship,
though they were
taken
as the
Fooleries
of a
False Religion
. We have in our days seen the
Representation
of the
Trinity,
Demolish'd in a
Church-Window,
with Extraordinary
Zeal
and
Approbation
.
To
. Why truly I am as much against the making of any
Image
or
Figure
of
God the Father
under the
Form
of a
Man,
as any body; for
Twenty Mistakes
and
Inconveniences
that may arise upon the consideration of such an
Object;
but I know no hurt in the world in the Representing of our
Saviour
under a
Human shape;
or of the
Holy Ghost
under the shadow of a
Dove:
beside that the thing is presum'd to have been done by
Authority;
for otherwise, the same
Zeal
that Destroys but the
Window
of the
Church,
would not stick at the Destroying perhaps of every thing else that belongs to't. But prethee tell me One thing, suppose the
Blessed Trinity,
so Represented, should be the
Seal
of an
Ancient
Community, or
Society
of men, what's the difference betwixt that
Figure,
in
Graving,
or in
Nealing;
in
Silver,
or in
Glass?
Would not you as much
scruple
that putting of that
Seal
to a
Lease,
as the
seeing
of that
Figure
in a
Church-Window?
Wh
. No; by no means; for the
One
is Purely a
Civil Act;
and the
Other
has a Regard to
Religious Worship
.
To
. And yet this
Image,
or
Pretended Resemblance,
is the
same thing
in the
One,
as it is in the
Other
. Well! I am Extremly pleas'd with this Private Corner for Liberty of Discourse.
Wh
. Here you may have all the
Papers
as they come out,
Fresh and Fresh:
All the
Arguments,
and
Politiques
of the
Dissenting Party;
Chuse
your own Theme,
Take
your own time,
and Treat upon
your own Conditions
.
To
. That's as fair as any Mortall can wish; So that when the day does not afford other matter to work upon, we may Look a little more narrowly into the
Merits
of the
Cause
. And so much for that. But here let me ask ye a Question: Do you know a
Little Cause-Jobber
yonder somewhere about
Kings-street, in Covent Garden?
Wh
. Does he not use the
Christian Coffee-House?
To
. The very same. He was saying t'other day that [
L'Estrange
was a
Pensioner of Cromwels;
a
Papist;
and that he durst not bring his
Action
against any man for
Calling
him so: That he was a
Rogue;
a
Fidler;
Liv'd in
Covent-Garden
a good while, and got his
Living
by his
Trade;
And that a
Magistrate,
not far from that place, would
Justify
it. The Two first Points, I suppose, will be Disputed in another place: And for the
Fidler:
'Tis well known that
L'Estrange
liv'd Eight or Nine years in one of the
Piazza-Houses
there; and kept
Servants
that would have Scorn'd to have Sorted themselves with any thing so mean as this
Paltry Varlet
. But to the Business. How far will the
Privilege
of a
True-Protestant-Whig
Justify a
Villain
in so many
Scandalous Lyes?
Wh
. So far as the
Common Good
of the
Cause
is more Valuable then the
single Credit
of a
Private Person
. But say ye now to
Curtis's Advertisement
(in his Last
Mercury
) of
Tong's Narrative,
and
Case;
concerning
L'Estrange,
printed for C W?
To
. I say, 'tis
first,
a
Cheat;
for 'tis none of
Tong's Writing;
2
1y,
'Tis
Another Cheat;
for 'twas Printed for
Langley Curtis,
with his Name to
Tongs Appointment
for the Printing of it: Only he has Fobb'd a
New,
and a
False Title-Page
to't. But what says Mr.
Oates,
all this while, to
L'Estranges Enformation
against
Tonge,
in the
Shammer Shamm'd?
where that young Fellow has the Impudence to declare under his hand, the very
Foundations
of
Oates's
Plot to be a
Cheat:
And
I appeal to all Good Protestants for Justice upon that Scandalous Wretch
.
Wh
. Nay, 'tis a horrible Abuse, and really the man stands in's own light: What was't? 500 or a 1000 Pound that he recover'd of One that did not say the Hundredth part of what this comes to? The Lord Deliver me! I knew the Time when 'twas
half a Hanging-matter
to have made the least doubt of any Branch of the Hellish Plot: But for this Audacious Fool to say in Expresse Terms, that [
the
Four Jesuites Letters,
wherein
Oates
pretended was the whole Discovery, were
counterfeits] is utterly Intolerable. I'le e'en go my ways immediately, and talk with the Doctor about it.

THE OBSERVATOR. In
QUESTION
and
ANSWER
.
WEDNESDAY
, April 13, 1681.
Q
.
WELL! They are so. But do you think now to bring'um to their Wits again with a
Pamphlet?
A
. Come, Come; 'Tis the
Press
that has made'um
Mad
, and the
Press
must set'um
Right
again. The Distemper is
Epidemical;
and there's no way in the world, but by
Printing
, to convey the
Remedy
to the
Disease
.
Q
.
But what is it that you call a
Remedy?
A
. The
Removing
of the
Cause
. That is to say, the
Undeceiving
of the
People:
for they are well enough Disposed, of themselves, to be Orderly, and Obedient; if they were not misled by
Ill Principles
, and Hair'd and Juggled out of their Senses with so many Frightful
Stories
and
Impostures
.
Q
.
Well! to be Plain and Short; You call your self the
Observator:
What is it now that you intend for the Subject of your
Observations>
A
. Take it in few words then. My business is, to encounter the
Faction
, and to Vindicate the
Government;
to detect their
Forgeries;
to lay open the Rankness of their
Calumnies
and
Malice;
to Refute their
Seditious Doctrines;
to expose their
Hypocrisy
, and the
bloudy Design
that is carry'd on, under the Name, and Semblance, of
Religion
; And, in short, to lift up the Cloke of the
True Protestant
(as he Christens himself) and to shew the People, the
Jesuite
that lies skulking under it.
Q
.
Shall the
Observator
be a
Weekly Paper,
or How?
A
. No, No; but oftner, or seldomer, as I see Occasion.
Q
.
Pray favour me a word; When you speak of a
True Protestant,
don't you mean a
Dissenting Protestant?
A
. Yes, I do: For your
Assenting
and
Consenting Protestant
(you must know) is a
Christian
.
Q
.
And is not a
Dissenting Protestant
a
Christian too?
A
. Peradventure, he
is
one; peradventure,
not:
For a
Dissenter
has his Name from his
Disagreement
, not from his
Perswasion
.
Q
.
What is a Dissenter then?
A
. Tis Impossible to say either what a
Dissenter IS
, or what he is
NOT
. For he's a
NOTHING;
that may yet come to be
ANY thing
. He may be a
Christian;
or he may be a
Turk;
But you'l find the best account of him in his
Name
.
A DISSENTER, is one that thinks OTHERWISE
. That is to say, let the
Magistrate
think what he pleases, the
Dissenter
will be sure to be of
another Opinion
. A
Dissenter
is not of
This
, or of
That
, or of
Any Religion;
but
A Member Politique of an Incorporate Faction
: or Otherwise; A
Protestant-Fault-Finder
in a
Christian Commonwealth
.
Q
.
Well! but tho' a
Dissenter
may be
any thing;
A
Dissenting Protestant
yet tells ye
what
he
Is.
A
. He does so, he tells ye that he
is
a
Negative
: an
Anti-Protester;
One that
Protests AGAINST
, but not
FOR
any thing.
Q
.
Ay; but so long as he opposes the
Corruptions
of the Church of
Rome.
A
. Well: And so he does the
Rites
, and
Constitutions
of the Church of
England
too. As a
Protestant
, he does the
former;
and the
Other
as a
Dissenter
.
Q
.
But there is no
Uniting
of These
Dissenters?
A
. You shall as soon make the Winds blow the same way, from all the Poynts of the Compass.
Q
.
There are
Good
and
Bad,
of
all Opinions,
there's no doubt on't: But do you think it fayr, to Condemn a
whole Party
for some
Ill men
in't?
A
. No, by no means: The
Party
is neither the
Worse,
for having
Ill
men in it, nor the
Better,
for
Good
. For whatever the
Members
are, the
Party
is a
Confederacy;
as being a
Combination
against the
Law
.
Q
. But
a man may
Mean honestly,
and yet perhaps ly under some
Mistake.
Can any man help his Opinion?
A
. A man may
Mean well,
and
Do Ill
; he may shed
Innocent Bloud,
and
think he does God good Service
. 'Tis True: A man cannot help
Thinking'
but he may help
Doing:
He is
Excusable
for a
Private
Mistake, for
That's
an Error only to
himself;
but when it comes once to an
Overt Act
, 'tis an
Usurpation
upon the
Magistrate
, and there's no Plea for't.
Q
.
You have no kindnesse, I perceive, for a
Dissenting Protestant;
but what do you think of a bare
Protestant
without any
Adjunct?
A
. I do look upon
Such
a
Protestant
to be a kind of an
Adjective Noun-Substantive; It requires something to be joyn'd with it, to shew its Signification
. By
Protestancy
in
General
is commonly understood a
Separation
of Christians from the Communion of the Church of
Rome:
But to
Oppose Errors,
on the
One hand
, is not Sufficient, without keeping our selves
Clear
of Corruptions, on the
Other
. Now it was the
Reformation
, not the
Protestation
, that Settled us upon a
true Medium
betwixt the two
Extremes
.
Q
.
So that you look upon the
Protestation,
and the
Reformation,
it seems, as two several things
.
A
. Very right; But in such a manner only, that the
Former,
by Gods Providence, made way for the
Other
.
Q
.
But are not all
Protestants
Members of the
Reformed Religion?
A
. Take notice,
First,
that the
Name
came Originally from the
Protestation
in 1529. against the
Decree of Spires;
and that the
Lutheran Protestants
and
Ours
of the Church of
England,
are not of the
Sam Communion
. Now
Secondly;
If you take
Protestants
in the
Latitude
with our
Dissenters,
they are not so much a
Religion,
as a
Party;
and whoever takes this Body of
Dissenters
for
Members
of the
Reformed Religion
sets up a
Reformation
of a
hundred and fifty Colours
and as may [sic]
Heresies
. The
Anabaptists, Brownists, Antinomians, Familists, &c
. do all of the set up for
Dissenting Protestants;
but God forbid we should ever enter these
People
upon the Roll of the
Reformation
.
Q
. Well!
but what do you think of
Protestant Smith
and
Protestant Harris?
A
. Just as I do of
Protestant Muncer,
and
Protestant Phifer;
a Brace of
Protestants
that cost the Empire 150000 Lives: and our own
Pretended Protestants
too, of Later Date, have cost
This Nation little lesse
.
Q
.
Ay: But these are men of quite another Temper: Do not you see how zealous they are for the Preservation of the
King's Person,
the
Government,
and the
Protestant Religion?
A
. I
See
well enough what they
Say,
and I
know
what they
do
. Consider,
First,
that they are Profess'd
Anabaptists: Smith
no less than a
pretended Prophet;
and the
Other,
a kind of a
Wet Enthusiast
.
Secondly;
'tis the very
Doctrine
of the
Sect
to root out
Magistracy,
Cancel
Humane Laws; Kill,
and take
Possession;
and
wash their Feet with the Bloud of the Ungodly;
and where ever they have set Footing, they have
Practic'd
what they
Taught
. Are not these likely men now, to help out a
King,
and a
Religion,
at a dead lift? If you would be further satisfy'd in the Truth of things, reade
Sleidan, Spanhemius, Gastius, Hortensius, Bullinger, Pontanus,
The
Dipper dipp'd, Bayly's Disswasive, Pagets Heresiography,
&c.
Hortensius
tells ye, how
Jack of Leydens Successor
murthered his Wife, to make way to his Daughter,
P
. 74. and after that, cut a girls throat, for fear she should tell Tales.
Gastius
tells us of a Fellow that cut off his brothers Head, as by Impulse, and then cry'd,
The Will of God is fulfilled, lib
. I.
Pa
. 12.
Jack of Leyden
started up from Supper,
to do some business
(he said)
which the Father had commanded him,
and cut off a Soldiers Head; and afterwards cut off his Wives head in the
Market-place
.
Sleydans Comment. Lib
. 10.
Q
.
You will not make the
Protestant-Mercury
to be an
Anabaptist
too, will ye?
A
. If you do make him
any thing,
I'le make him
That
. But in one word, they are
Factious
and
Necessitous;
and consequently, the fittest Instruments in the world, for the promoting of a
Sedition
. First, as they are
Principled
for't; and then, in respect of their
Condition;
for they are every man of them under the Lash of the Law, and Retainers to Prisons; So that in their
Fortunes
they can hardly be
worse
. Insomuch, that it is a common thing for them to lend a Name to the countenancing of a Libel which no body else dares own.
Q
.
Well! but let them be as
poor,
and
malicious
as
Devils,
so long as they have neither
Brains,
nor
Interest,
what hurt can their Papers do?
A
. The Intelligences, you must know, that bear their
Names,
are not of
their Composing,
but the Dictates of a
Faction,
and the Venom of a
Club of Common-wealths-men
instill'd into those Papers.
Q
.
These are
Words,
all this while, without
Proofs;
Can you shew us particularly where the Venom lies?
A
. It is the business of every Sheet they Publish, to Affront the
Government
the
Kings Authority,
and
Administration;
the
Privy-Council;
the
Church, Bench, Juries, Witnesses;
All
Officers, Ecclesiastical, Military,
and
Civil:
and no matter for
Truth
or
Honesty,
when a
Forg'd Relation
will serve their turn. 'Tis a common thing with them, to get half a dozen
Schismaticall
Hands to a
Petition,
or
Address
in a corner, and then call it, the sense of the Nation: and when all's done, they are not above twenty Persons, that make all this clutter in the Kingdom.
Q
.
But to what End do they all this?
A
. To make the Government
Odious,
and
Contemptible;
to magnifie their own Party; and fright the People out of their
Allegeance,
by
Counterfeit Letters, Reports,
and
false Musters,
as if the sober and considerable part of the Nation were all on their side.
Q
.
We are in Common Charity
to allow,
for
Errors,
and
Mis-reports,
and not presently to make an Act of
Malice,
and
Design,
out of every
Mistake.
Can you shew me any of these
Counterfeits,
and
Impostures
that you speak of? These
Cheats
upon the
People,
and
Affronts
upon the
Government?
A
. Yes, yes; Abundantly. And Il'e give you Instances immediately upon every poynt you'l ask me: Only This note, by the way; That let them be
mistakes,
or
Contrivances,
or what you will, they all run Unanimously
against
the Government, without so much as one Syllable in
favour
of it: Which makes the matter desperately suspitious.
Q
.
Let me see then, in the First place, where any
Affront
is put upon the
Government.
A
.
Some Persons
(Says Smiths Prot. Int. N. 7.)
in
Norwich,
&c. who have a greater stock of
Confidence,
and
Malice,
then
Wisdom,
and
Honesty,
are so far transported with
Zeal
to serve the
Devil,
or his
Emissaryes
the
Papists,
that they are now Prosecuting several
Dissenting Protestants
upon
Stat. 35. Eliz.
&c.
(And so the Protestant-Mercury,
N.
15.)
Some People at
Norwich,
are playing the
Devil
for
Godsake:
several honest, peaceable,
Protestant Dissenters,
having been troubled for not coming to
Church,
or having been Present at
Religious Meetings &c.] Now what greater
Affront
can there be to
Government,
then This language,
First,
from an
Anabaptist
that is a
Professed Enemy
to
all Government;
and
Secondly,
from a
Private Person,
Bare-fac'd, to arraign a
Solemn Law:
A
Law
of this
Antiquity;
a
Law of Queen Elizabeth's,
(a Princesse so much Celebrated by our
Dissenters themselves
for her
Piety, Good Government,
and
Moderation;
) a
Law
which, upon Experience, has been found so
Necessary,
that the bare
Relaxing
of it, cost the
Life
of a
Prince,
the
Bloud
of
two or three hundred thousand
of his
Subjects
, and a
Twenty-years-Rebellion?
To say nothing of the dangerous Consequence of making it
Unsafe
for
Magistrates
to discharge their Dutyes, for fear of
Outrages,
and
Libells
.
Q
.
Well! but what have you to say now to the
Kings Authority,
his
Administration,
and his
Privy Council.
A
.
Smith
(in his
Vox Populi, P.
13.) saith, that
the King is oblig'd to pass or Confirm those Laws his People shall Chuse
.] at which rate, if they shall tender him a Bill for the
Deposing
of himself, he is bound to
agree
to't.
Secondly,
in the same Page,
he Denies the Kings Power of Proroguing, or Dissolving Parliaments;
which is an
Essential
of
Government
it self, under what Forms so-ever, and he's no longer a
King, without it
. And then for his
Administration, P
. 1. the
Anabaptist
charges upon his Majesty [
those many surprizing and astonishing Prorogations, and Dissolutions
(as he has worded his Meaning)
to be procur'd by the Papists
.] And then,
P
15. he wounds both the
King,
and his
Council,
at a Blow; in falling upon
those that make the King break his Coronation-Oath;
arraigning his
Council
in the
First
place, and the
King himself
in the
Second'
and that for no less than the breach of
Oath,
and
Faith
.——Wee'l talk out the Rest at our next Meeting.

THE OBSERVATOR In QUESTION and ANSWER.
SATURDAY
, May 14, 1681.
Q
u.
But which way lies
your
Humour
then?
A
. My way (and you must know) lies more to
History,
and
Books,
and
Politicks,
and
Religion,
and
such as That,
But take this along with you too; that I am for turning over of
Men,
as well as
Books;
for that's the Profitable Study when all's done.
Q
.
Pre'thee commend me to the
Common Hangman
then, If He that
turns over
the most
men
be the
Greatest Philosopher.
But how
turning over
of
Men?
A
. That is to say, I
Read
Them; I
Study
them; I speak of
turning over
their
Actions,
not their
Body s
. And Pray observe my
Simile
.
Every
Action
of a man s
Life
resembles
a Page
in a
Book. D'ye Mark me?
Q
.
I were to Blame else, But what are the Authors that you would recommend to a body s Reading?
A
. Why thereafter as the Subject is, As for
History;
ye have
Clarks Lives,
and
Examples; Lloyd's Memoirs;
the
Popes Warehouse,
&c. For
Politicks;
There's Mr.
Baxters Holy Commonwealth,
the
Assemblys Catechism,
The Letter about the
Black Box,
&c. For
Law,
ye have Mr.
Prinn's Soveraign Power of Parliaments; Smiths Vox Populi,
&c. For
Morals,
There's
Youth's Behaviour;
And then For
Deep Knowledge,
ye have
Brightman's Revelations Reveal'd; Lilly's Hieroglyphicks;
the
Northern Star, Jones of the Heart:
All Excellent Pieces in their Kinds, and not Inferior (perhaps) to any of the Ancients.
Q
.
I was never so happy as to meet with any of these Authors. But what d'ye think of
Cornelius Tacitus?
A
. A
Talking, Tedious, Empty Fellow
.
Q
.
Well but is not
Titus Livius
a pretty Good
Historian?
A
. Ha Ha Ha. That Same
Titus
is an Errant
Puppy,
a
Damn'd, Insipid, Lying Coxcomb
.
Titus Livius
a good
Historian
sayst thou? Why if I had a
Schoolboy
that writ such
Latin
I'de tickle his
Toby
for him.
Q
.
But what's your Opinion of
Caesars Commentaries
then? I mean, for a
Narrative?
A
. A
Narrative
d'ye say? Deliver me from such
Narratives!
Why 'tis no more to be compar'd to the
Narratives
that are written
now aday s,
then an
Apple
is to an
Oyster
.
Q
.
But however He was a very
Brave Fellow,
was he not?
A
. He was an
Arbitrary,
Oppressing, Tyrannical
Fellow
. And then for his
Bravery,
he did pretty well at the Battel of
Leipsick,
and after that, at
Lepanto;
and when you have said that, you have said all.
Q
.
You have read all these Authors, have you not?
A
. Why verily I
have,
and I have
not
. They are a company of
Lying, Ridiculing Rascals;
They do not
AFFECT
me at all: they are below me, they are not worth my notice.
Q
.
What would I give to be as well vers'd in
History,
as you are?
A
. And that's Impossible, let me tell ye; Utterly Impossible: For I reade just six times as much as any other Man. I have Read more
Folio's
then ever
Tostatus
read
Pages
. In one Word; I reade as much in
one hour,
as any other man reads in
six
.
Q
.
Why how can that be?
A
. Why you must know I have a notable Faculty that way. I read ye
two Pages
at a
view:
the
Right-hand
Page with
one eye,
and the
Left
with
t'other,
and then I carry
three Lines
before me at a time with
each eye
.
Q
.
But can ye
Keep
what ye
Reade,
at this rate?
A
. I
remember
six times more than I
reade;
for I supply all that was left out, and yet 'tis a wonderfull thing, I cannot for my heart's blood remember
Faces
. I dare swear I have taken one man for another twenty times; but I am altogether for
Things,
and
Notions,
d'ye see, and such like;
Countenances,
let me tell ye, don't
AFFECT
me; And yet I have a strange aversion for the two Faces I saw with you t'other day.
Q
.
What D'ye mean,
Kings-man
and
Church-man?
A
.
Devil's-man
and
Damms-man:
A couple of
Canary-Birds,
I'le warrant 'em: But
Kings-man
is better yet then
Duke's-man
.
Q
.
Why do ye talk thus of men of Quality, and Considerable Families?
A
. Well! but I may live to see their Honours laid in the dust tho' for all that. Prethee why is not
Circingle-man, Lawn-sleeve-man, Mitre-man,
as good a name as
Church-man?
Pray what Family is the same
Church-man
of, for I know a world of the
Name?
He's of the
Prelatical House,
I suppose, Is he not?
Q
.
Well, and is he ever the worse for that?
A
. Only
Antichrist
is the
Head
of the
Family
. Come let me talk a little roundly to ye. How many sound
Protestant Divines
may there be of that House now, d'ye think, in
England,
and
Wales,
and the Town of
Berwick upon Tweed?
not above
Six,
if I be a
Christian,
and all the rest are
Tantivy's,
and worshippers of the Beast: But I may live yet to have the scowring of some of their Frocks for 'em.
Q
.
Prethee when didst thou see Mr.
Sancroft?
A
. Not a good while; but
Harry
and I had a Crash t'other day yonder at
Greenwich
.
Q
.
What's become of
L'Estrange
I wonder?
A
. Who!
Towzer?
that
Impudent Dog;
That
Tory-Rascal;
That
Fidling Curr
. He's in the Plot with
Celiers,
and young
Tong,
as sure as thou'rt alive, and as Rank a
Papist
(let him swear what he will) as ever Piss't.
Q
.
But has he not taken the
Sacrament
to the
contrary?
A
. A
Popish Proselyte
is no more to be believ'd, upon his
Oath,
than the
Devil himself
if he were to Expound upon the
Gospel
. Why they have Dispensations to swear any thing.
Q
.
What and continue Papists still?
A
. Yes: And go on still with the Hellish Popish Plot, as heartily as ever they did before. Why don't you see how the Toad Brazens it out still that he was not at
Somerset-House?
tho'
Prance
and
Mowbray
swear they saw him there?
Q
.
Well, But who knows best? He
Himself,
or the
Witnesses?
A
. Not a fart matter; For whether 'twas so or not; It were better Forty such Rogues were Hang'd then one Kings-Evidence Disparag'd.
Q
.
But did they not swear a little short, think ye?
A
. Nay, they might have sworn
homer,
I must confess.
Q
.
But now you mind me of
Somerset-House;
Do'nt you remember a young Fellow of
Cambridge
that Refus'd to receive the Sacrament, because (as he told his Master) he was reconcil'd to the Church, of
Rome,
and Converted ,and Baptiz'd at
Somerset-House?
This is an old story ye must know. Why might not this be
Towzer?
A
. Nay as like as not, for the
Universitys
are the very
Seminarys
of
Popery,
and it will never be well with
England
till
those Calves
be turn'd a
grazing
.
Q
.
But is there no believing of a
Converted Papist
upon his
Oath?
Why does the Law receive 'em then (upon such and such Certain Tests) for
statutable Protestants?
A
. The
Law
never was among 'em as I have been. There's no such thing (I tell ye) as a
Converted Papist,
and he shall sooner change his
shape,
then his
Nature: Kiss a Book, Kiss mine Arse
.
Q
.
Why d'ye talk thus at random?
A
. Come, come, the
Outlandish Doctor
for my money: that told one of the
Macks
t'other day in the face of the
Bench,
that
he would let down his Breeches and shite upon him. Plain-dealing's a Jewell
.
Q
.
Thou'rt e'en as busy with a
Backside
as a
Glyster-Pipe.
But (sluttery a part) Pray have a care what ye say; for if a
Proselyted Papist
be not to be trusted upon his
Oath,
what becomes of the
Kings Evidence
that
swear
under the
same Circumstances?
But here's enough of this; and Pre'thee tell us now, how go squares in the
State
all this while?
A
. Oh very bad, very bad, nothing but
Tory-Rorys,
from the top to bottom.
Tory-Judges; Tory-Jurys; Tory-Justices; Tory-officers; Tory-Crackfarts; Tory-Pamphlets
. All,
Certiorari-men,
and
Yorkists
. But I rattled up some of 'em there at the —
What d'ye call't-House
— Oh they'r grown strangely Insolent since these Bawling Addresses.
Q
.
Why what do they do?
A
. Why they set ever
Rascally Squire
and
Doctor above
me: Nay, they'l scarce put off their hats to me unless I begin; and then they stand grinning at Me and my Train. Would you think now that a fellow should have the Impudence to call Me to an account, for nothing in the world, but saying, that
he had
a Bitch
to his
Wife,
and
she
a
Rogue
to her
Husband. And then to be call'd
Sirrah
for my pains, only for telling a
Court-Kinsman
of his that
I should Lace the Rogue, his Cozens Coat for him
. Well If I had not sent a Fool o'my errant I had had the Rascal in
Lob's
Pound before this time.
Q
.
And how came ye to miss?
A
. Why the Agent that I employ'd was so set upon his Guts, that he never minded the discourse at the Table. We had had him else. Or if he could but have got him to ha' me, we'd ha' done his business.
Q
.
But d'ye take this to be fair dealing now; to set any man at work to betray his Host; or give such language to people of Condition?
A
. What not when the
Protestant Religion
lies at
stake?
Why Pre'thee I tell the Proudest of 'em all to their Teeth, that they are
Villains
and
Scoundrells
. What do I care for their
Graces
and
Reverences
. they
Pimp
for
Preferment,
and some of 'em shall hear on't too
next Parliament
. But Hark ye I have a great deal of work upon my hands, and I want an
Ammanuensis
out of all Cry.
Q
.
Why ye had a Pretty Fellow to'ther day, what's become of him?
A
. I'l tell ye then. A
Taylor
had made him a
Garment:
and afterwards coming to him for the
mony,
he deny'd the Receit on't and being prest upon it, he offer'd to purge himself upon
Oath,
that he never had any such Garment. Upon this, the matter rested for a while; but any length, it was prov'd where he had
Sold
it, and so the Taylor had satisfaction. In short, I turn'd him away apon't, for he is no servant for me that's
taken
in a false Oath.
Q
.
How is it possible for you to go through with all your Writing-work?
A
. Nay that's true; considering what a deal of other business I have; for really there would be no Justice done, if I did not look after
Witnesses, Jury's,
Choice of
City-Officers,
Election of
Members
to serve in
Parliament,
both for
Town,
and
Country;
the disposing of
Ecclesiastical Dignitys;
the
Jurisdictions
of
Courts;
the
Government
of
Prisons;
the
Regulation
of
Messengers Fees:
In one word, the stress of the whole Government lyes in a manner upon my shoulders; And I am so
Harrass'd
with it, that I profess I was e'en thinking, a little before the Meeting of the last Parliament, to lay out a smatter of
Twenty
or
Thirty Thousand Pound
upon some Pretty Seat in the Country, and Retire.
Q
.
Why truly for a man that has seen the world as you have done, what can he do better?
A
. Yes, I have seen the world to my Cost. 'Twas a sad thing for me, you must think, that never went to bed in my Mothers House without four or five Servants to wait upon me, (and if I had a mind to a
Tart,
a
Custard,
or a
Cheesecake
at any time, I had 'em all at command:) to be
Hackny'd,
and
Jolted
up and down in a Forreign Country like a
Common Body
.
Q
.
But what was it that put you upon
Travel?
A
. The Desire I had to see
Religions,
and
Fashions:
And now it comes in my head. Did you ever see my
Grounds and Occasions of the Contempt of the Clergy?
Q
.
Was That Yours Then?
A
.
Mum;
betwixt friends. But I shall have a touch ere long at the
Creed-making
Rascal there.
Q
.
Who's that?
Athanasius?
A
. The very same. What a
Declaration
is there?
Q
.
But how d'ye like the Kings Declaration?
A
.
Not at all. Not at all
. It runs so much upon the
Arbitrary,
and the
Prelatick?
Yes, and upon something else too.
Q
.
Come, 'Faith we should not part with dry lips, What d'ye think of one
Roomer
now to the Health of? (Hark, and I'le tell ye.)
A
. I'le drink no
Traitors
Health.
Q
.
Why prethee what is
Civilly-Drinking
his Health, more then
Dutifully Praying
for't?
A
. No: I am of the mans mind that said, [I
hope the Devil will have him; and if there be any punishment in Hell greater then another,
I
hope the Devil will tear his soul to pieces
. So Farewell.
Q
.
What a Blessed sort of
Subjects
and
Christians
are these, that value themselves in the
One Capacity,
for their
Contempt
of
Authority:
And in the
other,
for the Zeal of Flying out into
Blasphemys,
and
Execrations,
instead of
Prayers?
But what shall
I
call this at last?
A Romantique, or
an
Historical Observator?

OBSERVATOR
. If I were the
Master
of a
Territory,
I would as soon
Trust
so many
Spirits
in my
Pulpits, to Blow a Pestilence thorough my Dominions,
as so many of our
Non-Conforming Divines;
and reckon my
People
much
Safer
too, under the Danger of a
Plague,
then under the
Consequences of a Schism:
For the
One Taints
but the
Bodies
of Men; the
Other Destroys
their very
Souls
; the
One
takes them
Promiscuously,
the
Good,
and the
Bad, One
with
Another:
But the
'Tother Marks,
and
Singles-out
the
Best Men
for
Ruine,
with a
Privilege
of
Exemption,
to those that neither fear
God,
nor
Man
. The
One
Sweeps away a number of Single
Persons;
the
Other
Tears to pieces the
Sinews
of a
Community
. The
One
does, in
some Degree,
Conduce to the
Purging
of a
Wicked Nation,
when the
Wrath
of
Heaven
is
Appeas'd
by the
Discharge
of some
Dreadfull Judgment
upon't; (as the
Air
is Clear'd by
Thunder
) The
Other
does All that is
Possible
to the
Filling-up
of the
Measure
of a
Publique Iniquity;
and the making of a Land
Ripe
for
Vengeance
.
TRIMMER
. Prethee what
Danger?
Or what needs this
Lashing,
when they are All
Tongue-Ty'd
; and Driven into
Holes,
and
Hiding-Places,
to keep out of the way of
Messengers,
and
Constables,
and out of the
Clutches
of the
Corporation-Act,
and
Other Penal Laws
against their
Private Meetings?
Obs
. What dost thou Talk of
Tongue-Ty'd
? Why I will undertake it; (and in
Serious Good Earnest
too)
Gagg
the Whole
Set
of'em Give Every man his
Pulpit,
or his
Chair,
and only a Bare
Standing
in't; and if they do not
Wink,
and a
Nod,
and
Cuff
any Prince in
Christendom
out of his
Dominions,
without a
Word Speaking,
I'le be thy
Bond-slave
. Why they do not do their Bus'ness, man, by the Force of
Logique, Grammar,
or by the
Dint of Theology:
But by
Groans, Pangs, Tragical Ululations, Silent Interjections, Whining Apostrophes, Melting Epiphonemas;
and in a word; by the Helps of
Natural Rhetorick,
without
Need,
of either
Sense,
or
Syllables
.
Trim
. They
Preach,
and
Pray,
without
Speaking
then.
Obs
. No No. They do
Talk
for
Fashion
-sake: But Observe it while you will; They move the
Passions
of their
Auditory,
in the
Belfry,
or the
Church-Porch, Forty times more
then Directly under the
Pulpit:
For the
Emphasis
of an
Action; a Motion, Tone,
or
Countenance,
makes a much Deeper
Impression,
than that of a
Naked, Empty, Sound:
And for
My Part,
I fancy, it might do as well for 'em to
Whistle
their
Preachments
as to
Articulate
them: For the
Master-piece,
or the
All in All
of it, lies Mainly, in
Hitting
the
Tune
.
Trim
. Dy'e call this
Reasoning
, or
Ridiculing
?
Obs
. 'Tis
Both
in
One:
For it is the
Ridiculous Truth,
and the
Just Reason, Method,
and
State
of the
Matter:
And when People are once
Juggled
Out
of their Wits,
they must be
Fool'd
Into
'em again
. Now there needs no more to the doing of
That Work,
then the bare
Drawing
of the
Curtain,
and letting People into the
Tyring-Room
. For the
Cause,
is all over,
Theatrical:
The
Actors
are
Hypocrites,
in their
Manners,
as well as in the
Etymon;
and the whole
Manage,
fitter for a
Stage,
then a
Pulpit
. So that the most
Certain Way
in
Nature,
for the making of the
Practice, Odious;
and the
Disabusing
of the
Undiscerning Multitude,
is to
lay Open
their
False Colours, Shapes,
&
Disguises;
and
Expose
Every thing in its
Naked Simplicity
to the
Light
.
Trim
. And what if a man should
Allow
This sort of People now, to be the most
Uncouth, Hideous Monsters
of the
Creation?
To have the
Teeth,
the
Nails,
the
Fierceness,
the
Strength,
& the
Appetite
of the most
Ravenous
of
Wild Beasts?
This Discourse, of
Caution,
and
Description,
might do well enough in the
Countrys
of
Lyons,
and
Tygers:
But what's All This, to
his Majesties Dominions,
where there are either
None
of These Creatures,
at all,
or No
Other,
at least, then such as have their
Nails Par'd,
and their
Chops Muzzled:
And no more
Danger
of them, at present, then of our
Beeves,
and
Muttons
.
Obs
. Dost not thou know that there are
Several
Sorts
, &
Degrees
of
Danger?
A man may be
Wheedled
into a
Precipice,
as well as
Thrown
into't: A man may be
Hugg'd
or
Suck'd
to
Death,
without any
Biting
, or
Scratching
in the Case: A man may be
Poyson'd
in his
Porridge,
as well as
Strangl'd
in his
Bed:
A man may have
False Opinions
Impos'd
upon him by a
Fallacy,
or
Fraud
in
Argument,
as well as
Extorted
from him, by the Force of
Menace,
and
Torment
. And his Bus'ness, at last, is
done,
as
Dead
,
One way
as
T'other:
And so for the Degrees of
Danger;
There's
Danger at Hand;
there's
Danger
at a
Distance; Danger
in
Design,
and
Danger
in
Practice;
And
Danger,
in fine, through All the
Preparatory,
and
Mediate Tendencies
to
Mischief,
to the
Last Effect
that
Pushes
it self forth to
Execution
.
Trim
. Very Good! And what are All These
Sorts,
and
Degrees
of
Danger
to the
Instances
we have now
Before
us?
Obs
. 'Tis true; The
Faction
is not in Condition to
Attacque
the
Government
by
Force:
Their
Armies
are
Scatter'd,
and their
Squadrons Defeated;
the
Whole Party
put to their
Shifts;
and the very
Best
of 'em, has enough to do to
save his Own Bacon
. Their
Teeth
are
Drawn,
I'le Allow ye, All but here and there a
Stump;
And yet they'l
Pinch, Plaguily,
though they cannot
Worry,
and
Tear:
And with
Time,
and
Good Discipline,
they'l come to
Grow again
. They have the
Same Principles
to friend, that
ever
they had: Only they must be
Manag'd Another Way:
And there can never Want
Matter,
for
Artificial Flattery, Wheedling, Imposture
and
Hypocrisy,
to
Work
upon. They are not in Condition to
Advance,
at this time of Day, in the face of the
Sun,
and of the
Government,
with their
Petticoats Flying,
under the
Auspicious Direction
of their
Tutelary Angel, Ferguson;
and [
Fear Nothing but God
] for their
Motto
. But they must Supply want of
Strength,
by
Stratagem;
and
Carry-on
their
Approaches,
out of sight
. 'Tis only a little more
Patience,
and the
Work
will be brought about, as sure at the
Long-Run,
by a
Mine,
as by a
Battery:
And the
Certifying
of
a Hundred and Fifty Perrots
into the
Service,
and
Protection
Of
the
Government,
will be of Greater
Effect,
then the
Drawing-up
of
Ten Thousand men in Arms,
Against
it. Now
These Methods
lye All
Open
still, only they are somewhat more
About
. Now as to
Dangers Remote,
or
Nearer hand; Dangers of Design,
or
Dangers of Practice:
All the
Preparatories, & Dispositions to Mischief,
in their
Secret Impulses,
and
Causes,
are as
Vigorous
Now
, as
Ever
they were, that is to say, within Two or Three Motions of a
Publique Violence:
Only This Difference in the Case, that we have
Hitherto,
been in the
Greatest Danger
of our
Profess'd,
&
Open Enemies:
And
Now,
God bless us from our
Pretending Friends:
For all on a Sudden, the
Trimmers
are come-up to be
Stark Church-of-England-men;
And the
Phanatiques,
gotten a
Form Higher,
into the
Seat
or
Classes
of the
Trimmers
.
Trim
. Thou art
Well, neither Full nor Fasting
. Neither
Fanatique,
nor
Trimmer,
nor
Church-of-England-man
I perceive, will please ye; The
Controversy
of a
New King
; or a
Common-Wealth
, is
Out of Doors;
The Question of
Liberty of Conscience
; The
Privilege
of
Private Meetings
for
Religious Worship
; And a
Challenge
of
Dispensation
from the
Rites, Ceremonies, and
Discipline
of the Church, are
All layd aside
. And All This will not serve the
Turn
yet. Now if Men go to
Church;
Take
Tests,
make
Declarations;
And
Do
and
Perform
All that the
Law Requires
of'em; where's the
Danger
of These People I beseech ye?
Obs
. Not in their
coming over
with their
Bodies,
but in
Staying behind,
in their
Good Wills,
and
Affections:
Nay, and in their
Communicating
with the
Church
in the
Morning,
and in the
Afternoon,
with the
Schism:
And pray will you Note in them, One Thing
More
too. 'Tis worth the while, when they
Ramble
from their
Own Parish,
to
Observe
whither they go: For I have known the very
Streets Throng'd,
out of Distance of
Hearing One Word
that the
Minister says,
with the
Same Superstition,
that the
Quakers Flock
to the
Door,
when they are
Lock'd-out
of the
Meeting-House:
In which Case, It has yet the
Semblance
of a
Private Meeting;
And in Truth, looks liker a
Political Muster,
then a
Religious Exercise:
But Heark ye for One Word, before we go any further; Suppose a Man should have sayd about the
Beginning
of
July Last,
in a
Brisk Reply
to a
Reflexion
made upon the
Western-Rebells;
(at that time in their
Pride
and
Glory
) [
The King has as Loyal Subjects in That Army as Any are in T'other
.] Wouldst thou have me, in Construction of
Common Sense,
and
Honesty,
look upon
That Person,
to be, Effectually
Come over
, and in the
State
of
a True Church-of-England-man;
only for
Keeping
the
Law,
with his
Heels,
when he
Breaks
it, with his
Tongue,
and
Doctrine?
Now this is more then I Owe ye, upon the Matter in hand: For you have Carry'd the
Question
quite
back
again, from the
Non-Con-Ministers,
to the
Generality,
and the
Multitude
of the
Dissenters:
which is a Point Wholly
Excepted,
and out of the
Limits
of
Our Debate:
For All their
Conventicles
without a
Mouth,
are
Monsters;
Meer
Nullities,
&
Bilks,
without a
Teacher:
So that I have
Restrain'd
my
Applications,
Singly, to the
Rabbi's
of the
Faction,
as
Including,
and
Implying
the
Sense,
and the
Intent
of their
Disciples:
Nay and
so far Including
it, that they are
Barely,
the
Passive Instruments
of their
Leaders
. Now These
Heads
of the
Divided Parties,
are a sort of People, that do not, by any Means, fall within the
Charitable Prospect
of
Your Qualifications:
For they
Stand-off,
in
Contempt,
and
Defyance
of the
Orders,
&
Censures
of the
Church,
and of the
Law,
as much at
This Instant,
as
ever
they did. Their
Followers Maintain,
and
Support
them in That
Stubbornness
of
Disobedience;
And so the
Opposition
stands yet
Firm,
in
Effect,
though with
Less Noise
of
Menace,
and
Tumult
. The
Branches,
'tis True, are
Lopt;
but the
Root,
not so much as
Touch'd;
Nay, and in such a Condition of
Vegetative Virtue,
and
Vigour,
that it wants nothing but
Time,
and a
Favourable Season
to make it
Sprout
again. And This you may Assure your self of, that Nothing less than an
Utter,
an
Open,
a
Solemn,
and an
Irrevocable Divorce,
betwixt
These Libertine-Seducers,
and Those that have been
Trepann'd,
and
Inveigled,
out of the
Bosom
of the
Church,
into the
Arms
of the
Schism:
Nothing I say, less then Some such
Unalterable Act,
or
Decree
of
Separation,
can ever
Secure,
either the
Church,
or the
State
from the
Pernicious Consequences
of this
Intelligence:
For betwixt
Blind Pity,
and
Foolish Zeal,
on the
One
hand, and all the
Arts,
of
Moving,
and
Provoking
Those
Passions,
and
Affections,
on the
Other,
there is
kept-up,
and
Cherish'd,
a
Communication
of
Reciprocal Kindness,
between them that keeps the
Fire alive
still in the
Embers,
'till by
Degrees,
it
Blows-up
All at last into a
Common Flame
. Now take away
These Bellows,
and
T'other Sparks,
and a man may
Sleep
in his
Bed,
without
Dreaming
of
Conflagrations,
or the
Dread
of
Rising with his Throat Cut
.
Trim
. I will not Excuse some
Hot-Headed Blades,
that let their
Tongues
run before their
Wits;
And make it a Point of
Honour,
to
Brave
All the
Terrors
of
Death,
and
Dungeons,
in defence of the
Cause
that they have
Undertaken
. The
Less said,
the
Better;
Though a Body cannot, in
Generosity,
but have some sort of
Compassion,
for a Man that Suffers
Death,
with
Constancy of Mind,
Even in a
Mistaken Cause
, if it be according to his
Conscience
.
Obs
. If these
Impressions
were
Inbred,
and the
Errors
purely their
Own,
it would be a
Point,
not only of
Good Nature,
but of
Common Justice,
and
Humanity,
to have a
Tenderness
for
People
under an
Invincible Mistake:
But you have Started the
Strongest Argument
in the World, against your
self
here, by
Enforcing
the
Necessity
of Clearing the
Stage
of the
Seditious Oracles,
that
Inspire These Desperate Resolutions
.
Trim
. Why All matter of
Violence, Heat
of
Dispute,
and
Clamour
of
Argument,
is at an
End
. You hear no more of your
Scottish,
and
Western Declarations;
No more
Competitors
for the
Crown;
or
Confederates
for a
Republique:
And therefore prethee,
let
us be at
Peace
while we
May
be at
Peace;
and do not stand
Puzzling
the
People
with
Danger,
where
No Danger is
.
Obs
. Soft, and Fair,
Trimmer;
those
Declarations, Practices,
and
Attempts,
are not to be
Repeated
again in the
same Age:
But there are
more ways to the Wood then One:
And 'tis All a case, to a man that's
Robb'd,
whether the
Thieves
came in at the
Door,
or at the
Window
. 'Tis very Right, That, since the Breaking of the
Rebellion,
the
Non-Cons
lay their
Fingers
upon their
Mouths;
and not
One Word
of
Late,
upon the Subject of
Liberties,
and
Properties;
or of the Danger of
Tyranny,
and of
Arbitrary Power:
But All other
Grievances
are
Now
Swallow'd-up
in
One:
They are All in
Tears
for fear of the
Protestant Religion;
and
That's the Topique that's now Carry'd-on, through All Shapes, Figures, and Disguises
.

We shall have fine Work, Next Bout!

THE OBSERVATOR.
The way of Promoting
Fears,
and
Jealousies.
The
People
meerly

.
Both Parts seem to
Contend
for the
Same Common Principles.
The
Rise of Jelousies.
Saturday
, August 21. 1686.
TRIMMER
. The
Accommodating
of
Words
,
Phrases
, and
Texts
to the Matter in hand, with the Interjecting, here and there, of Certain
Emphatical Winks,
and
Innuendo's,
to the
Common People,
will do the Bus'ness of
Fears and Jelousies,
you need never
Doubt
it, without any more Ceremony.
OBSERVATOR
. I do no more
Doubt
it, then I do, that a
Proper Remedy
;
Rightly Prepar'd
; and
Administer'd
in the
Due
Time
and
Proportion
, will
Work
such or such an
Effect
. But the
Skill
lyes, in the
Judgment
of the
Distemper
; The
Constitution
of the
Patient
; The
Choice
of the
Physick
; The Prescription of the
Composition
, the
Preparation
, and the
Dos
. Now
Your
way of
Operating,
is only the
Mechanicall
Part of the Bus'ness;
and no more, then the giving of a
Box,
a
Gally-pot,
or a
Glass,
with a Note of
Directions,
out of
One
hand into
Another:
which Any
Porter
that Plyes at the
Next Corner,
would do as
Dext'rously,
as ever a
Doctor
of the
College
. The
Difficulty,
and the
Mystery,
is
Over
, before
You
have any thing to
Do
with it: The
Poysonous,
and
Intoxicating Draught,
Prepar'd
; The
Multitude
set a-
Gaping
for't, and
Your
Office,
is only at last, to
Pour it down their Throats
. There's Matter of
History,
and
Fact,
enough, 'this true, to
Satisfy any man,
that People may be made as
Mad
with
Cant,
and
Gibberish,
as if they had taken
Henbane;
and that
the
Sting
of
Jelousy
, will put them out of their
Wits
as soon as
the
Biting
of a
Mad-Dog
: But we are in the
Dark
all this while, for the
Rise
, the
Progress
, and the
Methods
of
Enflaming
Jelousies,
to bring'em up to that
Pitch
. Prethee let me Understand a little of their
Birth
,
Growth
,
Discipline
, and
Education
; How they are
Fed
,
Nourish'd
, and
Entertain'd
? What's the
End
, and
Use
of them? What
Language
do they
Speak;
or how comes it to pass, that the
Same
Words
, and
Phrases
, without
Any Intelligence
with
Grammar, Logique, Common Usage,
or
Propriety,
should
Transport
Some
Men
into
Outrages, Palpitations of the Heart, Horrors,
and
Tremblings,
both of
Mind,
and of
Body;
and yet Work no more upon
Others
, then they
did,
before the very
Letters
of'em were taken out of the
Alphabet?
I do not call ye to a
Strict Shrift
upon
Every Point,
but I Expect you shall say something to the
Whole Matter;
for a
Few Words,
in
Order
, will give a man more
Light
to the
Reason
of a thing, then as many
Volumes,
in
Confusion
.
Trim
. You are in the
Right;
that the
Craft
lies in the
Project
, and the
Preparatory
Manage
of this Affair, and that the
Danger
is gone too
Far,
when the
Mine
is already
Wrought;
the
Powder Dispos'd,
and nothing wanting to the
Final Execution
of the
Mischief,
but the
Lighting
of the
Match,
and the Applying of the
Coal
to the
Train
. You have
Well
and
Truly
enough
Observed,
the
Wonderfull Force,
that
Some Certain
Words
, and
Phrases
have; upon the
Affections
of the
Multitude;
without the Least
Shadow
of any
Logical
,
Grammatical
, or
Philosophical
Reason
for the
Operation
of them. Now you must know, that
These
Words
, and
Phrases
, are made
Use
of, and
Understood,
in the way of a
Cypher
, or a
Jargon
, and not according to the
Ordinary Acceptation
of them, in a
Regular
way of
Writing,
or of
Speaking;
So that, Effectually, the
Efficacy
of such
Words,
and
Phrases,
is given for
Granted;
and how they come to
Obtain that Force,
remains the
Single Question
.
Now towards the
Understanding
of this Matter, you must Consider, that no
State
can be
Supplanted,
but by
Turning
the
Peoples Hearts,
against the
Persons,
& the
Actions
of their
Superiors:
So that in
All Conspiracies
to
Destroy
a
Government,
Fears & Jelousies
, are
the
Corner Stone
of the Babel
. Their
Hearts
are no sooner
Lost,
but they withdraw their
Bodies
too, and so, by
Degrees, Erect
Laws
, and
Religions
of their
Own
; and look upon themselves, by This time, as in
Another Common-wealth
.
Obs
. 'Tis most
Certainly True;
and that in this
Separation,
they set-up an
Interest
of
Direct
Spite
, as well as
Opposition
, to That of the
Church,
and of the
State
.
Trim
. This is the very
Course
, and
Progress
of a
Popular Jelousy:
But pray take Notice as we go, that the
People,
are thus far,
Meerly
Passive
; and
Contribute No Otherwise,
to the
Ruine
of the
Publique,
then
a
Snapping Sea
does, to the
Sinking
of a
Vessell,
when the
Billows
are
Hurry'd-on
by the
Violence
of an
Irresistible Tempest
: if the
Winds
would but let the
Waves alone,
they'd be
Quiet
. When they come once to Gather into [
Private Meetings
,] (or as you call them,
Conventicles
) you may
Then
accompt upon it, that they are as good as put to
School,
to
Learn
the
Mystery
of their
Profession
. For there are
Canting-Schools
, as well as
Reading-Schools
; and under This
Discipline,
they come by
Insensible Degrees,
to part with their
English
Tongue
, as well as with their
English
Principles
, and
Manners
. Nay, and Effectually, to take up such
Uncouth, Novel,
and
Strange
Thoughts
,
Opinions
, and
Practices
, that it looks, as if the
English-Man
, the
Christian
, and the
Subject
, were
all lost in a Disguise
. They are now, you must know, under
New Lords
, and Consequently, under
New Laws
; where they are
Train'd-up
to
New Ways
of
Understanding
Things, and to a
New Idiome
of
Expressing
them.
Religion
,
Law
,
Government
,
Conscience
,
Good Manners
, are so
Sacred
in
Themselves
, that the
Worst
of Men cannot but
Pretend
a
Veneration
for them; but how to
Baffle,
or to
Elude
the
Force,
the
Obligation,
and the
Authority
of them; and, at the Same Time, to set-up for the
Asserters,
and
Supporters
of
These Publique Rights, Privileges,
and
Duties, There
lies the
Difficulty
of the
Understanding
.
Obs
. That is to say, how to
Resolve
Religion
, into an
Empty
Notion
: To
Talk Christianity
into a
Paradox
; and, with
Christ
in our
Mouths,
at
London,
to
fall down,
and
Worship
Mahomet
, in
Buda:
How to
Confound
Gods
, and the
Governments Friends
and
Enemies
, so as to make the
Common People
take
One
for
T'other
. Now This can be no way done, but by setting-up the
Counterfeit
of
Religion
,
Law
, and
Conscience
, against the
Genuine,
and
Authentique
Original
; and by making
Evil
, to be
Good
, and
Good
, to be
Evil
.
Trim
. You must
Note,
further, that in This
Opposition,
the
Main Cause
appears to be the
very Same,
on
Both sides;
and
Both Parts
seem to
Contend,
for
the
Same Common Principles
, of
Divine Worship,
and of
Civil Obedience
.
Obs
. Only the
One
Flies to the
Invisible Lights
and
Dictates
of the
Spirit,
in Matter of
Religion
; (taking
Fancy
for
Revelation
) and, in the Matter of
Government
, has Recourse to Certain
Unaccountable Whimsies,
of [
Powers Reserv'd
,] where there
never was any Power at all; & These Fooleries,
they
Trump
upon the
Little People,
under the
Pompous Name
of [
FUNDAMENTALS;
] while the
Rulers,
on the
Other
hand, Stick to the
Law
, to the
Text
, and to the
Approved Senses
of the
Best Interpreters
of
Both
, for their
Guide
.
Trim
. Very Good! And after they have
Departed
from the
Common Rule
, and
Divided
themselves from the
Common Interest
; it is but Reasonable to
Expect,
that they will Set-up
Another Interest
, and
Another Rule
to
Themselves
.
Obs
. Well
!
But how do they
Manage That Province
all this while, as to the
Subject,
I mean, that we were
Speaking
of?
Trim
. Why their way is, only to put
Religion,
and
Government
in
Another Dress;
but under the
Name
, of [
Religion
,] and [
Government,
]
Still;
and then to lay on a
Superstructure,
Answerable to the
Foundation;
I speak of the
Leaders
only; for their
Disciples
are
Blanck Paper;
and ready for
any Impression
. They
Talk,
to the
Ears
, and to the
Passions
of their
Hearers,
not to their
Understandings
: and their
Auditors
gather more of their
Meaning,
from their
Gestures, Actions, Countenances,
and from
Pathetical Tones,
then from the
Words Themselves
. As for
Sense,
or
No Sense,
'tis
all a Case;
for 'tis the
Jingle,
not the
Matter,
that does
Their Bus'ness
. The
Less
the People
Understand
, the
More
they are
Edify'd
; for they take the
Congruities
of
Carnal Reason
, for
Vain Philosophy
; and
Incomprehensible Nonsense
, passes for
the Work of the
Light Within
. Their
Religion
lies alltogther in
Groan
, and
Rapture
:
They Sacrifice to the
Unknown God
; and in One Word; They
Supply
the
Want
of
Knowledge
, with an
Excess
of
Zeal
; and when they cannot
Understand
the
Plain English
of a
Discourse,
they Wrap Themselves up in the
Mystery
. The making of a
Party,
& the Saving of their own
Skins,
are the
Two Main Points
of the
Leaders;
and therefore, they
Cover
themselves under
Ambiguity
, &
Riddle
; & Compass those Matters, by
Theatrical Gesticulations,
&
Actions,
which they dare not
Venture
upon, in
Words
at
Length,
or by the
Dint
of
Argument;
for there is no
Law
against
making of
Faces
,
and Dusting of
Cushions
, They are told
Mightily,
and
Plainly,
or
Heaven,
and
Hell;
but in such a
Manner,
that they will
Never Allow
God
, and the
Government
to be
Both of a side
.
Schism
is Dignified with the
Name
of
Conscience
; the Story of their
Grievances,
is the
Bitterest
of
Satyrs
; Their very
Petitions
have the force of
Invectives;
and the
Smoother,
the
Softer,
you find the
Surface
of them, the
Falser,
and the more
Dangerous
they are at the
Bottom:
For betwixt the
Persecution
that is
Insinuated,
on the part of the
Government,
& the
Innocence
, the
Piety
, and the
Modesty
, on that of the
Sufferers
, Nothing can more Provoke, a
Horror,
and
Indignation
for the
One,
or a
Tenderness,
&
Compassion,
for the
Other
.
Obs
. That is to say, among Those that are not
Well Enform'd,
in the
Reason,
and the
Equity of the Cause in Question
.
Trim
. Come Come. I tell ye
Nakedly
how things
Are
, and not how they
Ought
to be: and I speak of
Those Men
too, that neither
Do
, nor
Will
, nor
Can
make a
Right Judgment
upon the Matter in
Issue
. They do not take down
Reasons
in
Connexion
; neither do their
Teachers
so much as
Offer
at'em; But
their Work
is, only to
Feed
Itching Ears
, and
Humours
, with
New-Quoyn'd Words. Affectate Phrases:
And briefly, to
Instruct
their
Disciples,
by
Signs
and
Tokens,
like so many
Dancing Horses
to fall
Lame upon all Four
, for the
Pope;
to
come-over
, for the
Grand Vizier;
and at the very
Sound
of
Babylon
,
Anti-Christ
, or
Absolute Power
, to
Snort
, and
Boggle
, as if they
Smelt Fire
. If I may tell ye the
Arrant Truth,
and
Simplicity
of my
Heart;
This is the very
Train
of a
Popular Institution
. They are
Tutor'd
, and
Inur'd
, to the
Assuming
of such and such
Passions,
upon such and such
Occasions;
and they do All their
Ayres,
and
Tricks,
by the Direction of the
Hand,
or
Eye
.
They Dance
to
Sounds, Hints, Nodds, Forms,
and
Syllables;
not to the force of
Fair Reasonings,
and
Natural Conclusion;
Nay, they are
Taught
, when to be
Angry;
when to be
Pleas'd;
and their very
Inclinations,
and
Aversions,
are none of their
Own, Neither:
The
Whole Bus'ness,
in short, is
Artifice
,
Manage
, and
Practice
; for
All their
Mistakes
,
and
Mis-understandings
,
take the
Same Biass
.
Obs
. I do
Observe,
indeed, that they Shelter themselves under the
Dark Prophets,
and the
Revelation
. The
Number of the Beast,
they have all at their
Fingers Ends;
the
Geneva-bibles
are
Thumm'd
over and over, at the
Same Texts:
As upon the Subject of the
Groves,
& the
High Places, Christian Liberty, Will-Worship, Humane Inventions, Idolatry, Superstition,
&c. There's not a
Verse
in the whole
Bible,
against
Persecution,
but makes them Shake their Heads at the
Government
.
Popery
by
Interpretation,
is
Episcopacy
: The
Liberty
of the
Subject
, has an
Aking Tooth
at the
Prerogative
of the
Prince
: but finally; such and such
Terms
, and
Forms
of
Speaking
, are by Common Consent, to pass for
Current,
under such or such a
Sense
, and
Meaning
, how
Contrary
soever, to their
Proper,
and
Genuine Signification,
or
Import
. But this speaks only to the
Propagating
of
Jelousies,
not to the
Rise
of them.
Trim
. If you Ask me the [
Rise
] of
Jelousies,
I must
Answer
ye, that they are
Begotten
betwixt
Ambition
,
Avarice
,
Hypocrisy
,
Craft
,
Malice
, and
Disloyalty
, on the
One
side; and
Ignorance
,
Obstinacy
,
Blind Zeal
, and an
Impetuous Temerity
, on the
Other
.
